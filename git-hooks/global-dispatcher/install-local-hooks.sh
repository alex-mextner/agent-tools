#!/bin/sh
# install-local-hooks.sh — wire ONE repo into the global git-hook dispatcher.
#
# THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES
#   A global `core.hooksPath = ~/.config/git/hooks` makes every global hook fire in
#   normal repos. But a repo with a LOCAL hook manager overrides core.hooksPath
#   (lefthook -> .git/hooks, husky -> .husky/_) or ships raw .git/hooks, and those
#   SHADOW the global hooks entirely. This script injects ONE call to the dispatcher
#   (`run-global-hooks <event>`) into whatever the repo already uses, so EVERY global
#   hook in ~/.config/git/global-hooks.d/<event>/ runs there too — now and forever,
#   with no further per-repo edits when new global hooks are added.
#
# WHY ONE LINE COVERS ALL FUTURE HOOKS
#   We never inject individual hooks (secret-scan etc.). We inject the dispatcher,
#   which enumerates global-hooks.d/<event>/ at runtime. Drop a new file there and it
#   runs in every wired repo automatically.
#
# IDEMPOTENT
#   Every injection is guarded by a marker comment (MARKER below). Re-running is a
#   no-op once present. Nothing is ever clobbered: lefthook gets a MERGED command,
#   husky/raw get an APPENDED guarded line, and an existing raw hook keeps its body.
#
# DEDUP (auto)
#   Before wiring, we scan the repo for a check it ALREADY runs locally that a global
#   fragment also provides — today: a secret scan (a `gitleaks` / `secret-scan` /
#   no-secrets command in lefthook.yml, .husky/*, raw hooks, or a tracked
#   git-hooks/no-secrets-scan). If found, we add that capability id to the repo's
#   tracked `.githooks-skip`, so the dispatcher skips its global copy here and the
#   check runs EXACTLY ONCE. See the DEDUP section in run-global-hooks.
#
# USAGE
#   install-local-hooks.sh [--commit] [--no-dedup] [REPO_DIR]   # default: repo of $PWD
#   Detects the manager automatically: lefthook (lefthook.yml) | husky (.husky/) |
#   raw (.git/hooks).
#     --commit    : after wiring, commit the TRACKED wiring changes (lefthook.yml,
#                   .husky/<event>, .githooks-skip) in the repo with a fixed message.
#                   Makes the wiring a reproducible, tracked step (no-op if nothing
#                   changed, or if the only changes are untracked .git/hooks files).
#     --no-dedup  : skip the auto secret-scan detection / .githooks-skip write.
#   For lefthook in a pull-only checkout, run on a branch and commit it (or use
#   --commit) — this script edits the tracked file in place.
#
# EXIT: 0 on success / already-wired; non-zero on a real failure.
