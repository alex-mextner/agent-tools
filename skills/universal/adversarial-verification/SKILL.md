name: adversarial-verification
description: Use when verifying a fix or a finding — before claiming "works", "no longer happens", or "always works". Don't confirm the happy path; try to break it. Build the case where it MUST fail, hunt the counterexample, name the real boundaries, and prove with an artifact (rendered output, test run, screenshot), not "the helper returns empty" or "correct by construction".

# Prove it from the opposite side

Confirming that a fix works is the weakest test you can run — you go looking for the
case that passes, you find it, you stop. That's how a fix ships that only ever worked
on the one input you tried. Verification is not "show it works"; it's *try to break it
and fail*. Until you've attacked the claim and it survived, you haven't verified it —
you've reassured yourself.

## Rule

When you verify a fix or a finding, do the opposite of confirming it:

- **Attack the claim.** Build the input where it *must* fail — empty, null, boundary,
  the largest, the malformed, the concurrent. Actively construct the counterexample,
  don't wait for one to wander in.
- **A "no longer happens" / "always works" claim demands a refutation attempt.** Any
  universal claim ("always", "never", "no longer", "every case") is only earned by
  trying to refute it. If you find a counterexample, decide: is it an intended boundary
  or a real bug? If you don't, document *which* cases you actually tried.
- **Proof is an artifact, not a story.** "The helper returns empty", "it's correct by
  construction", "the code clearly does X" are not proofs — they're restated intent.
  A proof is something you can attach: the rendered DOM, the generated output, the test
  run with its assertion, the screenshot. Walk the *real* path (render / generate /
  execute end-to-end), not just the unit boundary the bug might never reach.
- **Name the floor.** State explicitly where the fix does *not* hold — the edge cases,
  the inputs it punts on. A documented boundary is honest; a silent "universally
  works" is a lie waiting to be found in production.

## The two-sided check

For any claim, run both sides — the positive proof *and* the refutation attempt:

```text
// Claim: "after the fix, <Badge/> always renders its children"

// (1) Positive — prove via the real rendered output, not a unit return:
render(<Badge>hi</Badge>)
assert dom.text == "hi"      // proof = the actual DOM, not "the helper returned 'hi'"

// (2) Adversarial — find the input where it is OBLIGED to fail:
render(<Badge>{null}</Badge>)
assert dom.text == ""        // counterexample: "always" is refuted
                             // → decide: intended boundary (floor) or bug?
```

Only side (1) is "it works on the case I picked". Side (2) is verification.

## Where this applies

- **Bug fixes** — reproduce the original failure first, then attack the fix with the
  neighbors of the failing input, not just the one ticket case.
- **"It's gone now" claims** — a flake, a race, a leak said to be fixed. Try to make it
  recur (more load, more iterations, the exact timing) before believing it.
- **Findings in a review or investigation** — before you assert "this branch is
  unreachable" or "this value is never null", construct the path that reaches it.

## Why

Confirmation bias is the default failure mode of self-verification: you test toward the
answer you want. The cheapest counter is to invert the goal — make breaking it the win
condition. What survives a genuine attempt to break it is verified; what you merely
failed to break by not trying is not.

The companion habits: separate the worker from the critic so the attacker isn't the
author (`gan-critic-loop`), and for anything user-visible, capture and *look at* the
real render rather than trusting the code (`visual-proof-cycle`).
