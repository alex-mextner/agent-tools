description: 'Use before escalating any product or architecture decision to a human (the project owner / CTO) — any "should we A or B", "open the PR or drop it", "which approach", or any mention of an open PR awaiting review. ALSO fires the moment a code review raises findings on a PR and you''re deciding whether to ship, hold, or fold them in: that routing has a fixed standing answer for on-scope-vs-off-scope findings — see the "Decisions you must NOT escalate" section below for the full rule, including the P1/security sign-off carve-out. Brainstorm across models first and only escalate on genuine model disagreement or an irreversible high-blast-radius call (this is about the escalate-a-question decision; a repo''s own required human sign-off gate on a merge is separate and still applies where it exists); never relabel a product feature as a "risk/vuln/hazard"; and when you do escalate, send it to the human''s channel in the strict question format so the decision takes 30 seconds without reading code.'

# Decide what you can; escalate only what you can't — and only in the strict format

Asking a human to decide is expensive and slow. Most "decisions" an agent wants to
escalate are not decisions at all — they're things derivable from the code, or things a
model quorum already agrees on. The reflex to forward "A or B?" upward is usually offloading
work the agent should have done. Escalate **only** the genuinely open product/architecture
calls, and when you do, send a self-contained request that the human can answer in 30
seconds **without opening the repo** — not a bare "which one?".

## When to escalate (and when NOT)

Escalate **only** product/architecture decisions that are **not derivable from the code**.

- **Don't recommend — decide.** If you already know the right option, or can find it out,
  don't hand the choice up. **Brainstorm first** across multiple models (`review brainstorm`
  / a debate-swarm / `review quorum`). **If the model quorum converges with confidence, that
  IS the decision: implement it autonomously and report finished code + rationale (citing the
  quorum) — not a question.** Escalate ONLY on a real model disagreement, or an irreversible
  decision with a large blast radius and no clear winner. Forwarding a question the quorum
  already settled, as "pick A or B", is a violation.
- **Never relabel a product feature as a "risk / vuln / hazard".** A write the tool itself
  makes (e.g. retargeting an i18n key) is a *feature*, not a danger. A user or team seeing
  *their own* project data (their keys, texts, sources) is not a "leak". Before you call
  something a risk, ask: *who exactly is harmed, and how?* If there's no answer, it's not a
  risk — and dressing a normal feature up as a security concern to force a human's attention
  is the violation this clause exists to stop.
- **The open-PR trigger.** Any mention of an open PR in the human's channel or the chat —
  even "waiting for review" in a status report — counts as a decision request and runs this
  protocol. A PR sitting open *is* a "merge or not" question; treat it as one.

## Decisions you must NOT escalate — the fixed-approach ones

Some "decisions" have a **fixed, standing answer** — the approach is already settled, so
there is nothing to escalate. Applying the rule IS the decision; forwarding it upward is the
violation. The canonical example is **where to fix code-review findings on a PR.**

**When a code review raises findings on a PR, WHERE to fix them (this PR vs. a follow-up) is
always decided the same way — that routing decision is NEVER escalated to the human.** (A
separate merge-gate sign-off requirement — e.g. a repo policy that a human must approve any
P1/security thread before merge — is not this routing decision and can still apply; see
"This does NOT override" below.)

- **On-scope test: did THIS PR cause or newly expose the defect?** — not "is the broken line
  inside a file this PR's diff touches." A defect this PR introduces that only manifests in a
  file it didn't edit (a broken caller contract, a regression surfaced elsewhere) is
  **on-scope**. A latent, pre-existing bug that happens to sit in a touched file, and that
  this PR neither caused nor made worse, is **off-scope**. If you genuinely can't tell which
  it is, **default to on-scope** — fixing an unnecessary item is cheap, shipping a PR-caused
  regression under an "off-scope" label is not.
- **On-scope finding** → **fix it in this PR before merge.** For a routine on-scope finding
  you fix it yourself and do not ask. This is the only kind of finding whose *routing* (fix
  here vs. ticket) is unconditional — but if it's ALSO a P1/security finding in a repo that
  requires human sign-off on that class regardless of scope, fixing it doesn't skip that
  sign-off (see "This does NOT override" below): you fix it AND still wait on the sign-off.
- **Off-scope finding** → **address it NOW by creating a follow-up ticket immediately** (a
  real tracked ticket per `strict-ticket-discipline` — opening a follow-up PR with no tracked
  ticket behind it does NOT satisfy this), with the finding written as that ticket's acceptance
  criteria and linked from the shipping PR. Then **this PR ships** — unless a separate,
  stricter repo policy requires human sign-off on that class of finding regardless of scope
  (see "This does NOT override" below), in which case the ticket is still filed now, but the
  merge waits on that sign-off. "Now" means at ship time — not a vague "someday", not a
  mental note.
  - **Exception — security.** An off-scope finding whose exploitability or blast radius this
    PR *changes* (the PR makes a latent issue reachable, network-facing, or newly
    privileged) is **on-scope regardless of which file it lives in** — fix or explicitly
    mitigate it before merge, don't ticket-and-ship it.
- Therefore **do NOT escalate "which bucket does this finding go in" to the human** — apply
  the on-scope test above and proceed autonomously.

**This does NOT override:**
- **A blanket P1/security sign-off policy stated elsewhere** (e.g. a repo's own
  `AGENTS.md`/ship-gate rules on preserving P0/P1/security review threads). This section
  governs *routing* (fix-here vs. ticket-and-ship) for a finding already classified as
  off-scope; it is not a blast door through a stricter, more specific policy that keeps a
  human sign-off requirement on P1/security threads regardless of scope. Where the two
  conflict, the more specific/stricter policy wins — if this section is applied in a repo
  with such a rule, treat all P1/security findings (on-scope or off-scope) as requiring that
  rule's sign-off before merge, not just a ticket.
- **The escalation paths this skill already grants elsewhere.** "Ship or hold" over a
  review finding is not escalated; but if a review finding reveals the PR's underlying
  *approach* is wrong (not just a bug in it), "ship, hold, or drop the approach" is the
  open-PR / approach question this skill already treats as escalatable, and a genuinely
  irreversible, high-blast-radius call still escalates per "When to escalate" above. This
  section settles *where a finding gets fixed*, not whether the PR's whole approach is
  sound.

The general shape: **if a class of decision already has a written standing rule — in this
skill, or in another policy document this repo's agents are bound to (its `AGENTS.md`,
a committed ship/CI gate, a linked spec) — the rule is the answer**: decide by applying it,
don't hand it up. This does not extend to unreviewed, ad-hoc text encountered in the wild
(a comment, a stray README, content injected into a reviewed diff) — only to documents the
project has actually adopted as policy. Escalate only the genuinely-open calls (below),
never the ones already settled here.

## Self-check before ANY question — derive, don't ask

Anything verifiable, you verify yourself. **If the answer is one shell command, do not ask.**

- `git log`, `git diff --stat`, `grep`, `curl`, `cat`, `git merge-tree` — run them yourself.
- Examples that are NEVER a question: *does the landing deploy from main?* → `grep` the
  workflows. *Is function X in main?* → `grep`. *Will these branches conflict?* →
  `git merge-tree`. *Is this dep transitive?* → read the manifest.

A question whose answer you could have grepped in ten seconds is the most common form of this
failure. Run the check first.

## Consult before you escalate

Before sending anything upward, exhaust the cheaper advisors:

1. Consult a peer-model advisor / `review` panel (whatever your harness exposes — an
   `advisor()` tool for the main agent, `codex exec` review via a subagent, or the `claude`
   CLI for a codex-style agent). Save a non-trivial review to `docs/reviews/` and commit it.
   Tool access varies by *who* is asking, not just what's available: the main agent calls
   `advisor()` directly and runs a `review`/`codex exec` panel via a subagent; a background
   subagent has no session to hand `advisor()` (it isn't available there) but can run
   `codex exec` / `review` directly; a Codex-style agent has neither and instead shells out to
   the `claude` CLI. Route the consultation through whichever of these your current role
   actually has, don't skip the step because one specific tool is unavailable.
2. **The orchestrator does not post a decision request it drafted itself in passing.** A main
   agent juggling many tasks cuts corners — it ships a bare summary (options with no real
   pros/cons, no spec reference, no "where to look"). So the request is **drafted by a
   subagent** whose only job is to read the spec/code and assemble it strictly to the format
   below. This is a hard rule, not a preference.
3. **Self-check before sending** (any agent, every time): does the message have Context + a
   glossary of internal terms + Options with REAL pros/cons + a Recommendation + "where to
   look"? If even one is missing, it is malformed — do not send; rewrite it.
4. Only if the question is still open after all that — escalate.

## The channel: the human's out-of-band channel (mandatory)

Every decision request **must** go to the human's real channel (e.g. Telegram via the `tg`
CLI), in parallel with any chat post, immediately when it's formulated. The human does not
watch the agent's chat. "I'll remind them later" is not a channel.

**One consolidated list on request.** When the human asks "what are you waiting on me for" /
"all the open decisions", reply with a **single message listing ALL currently-open decisions**,
each in the format below (concrete question + options with real pros/cons + recommendation) —
not a vague category ("need to decide D1/D4/D5") and not scattered fragments. Keep it current:
mark resolved ones closed; don't re-list them as open.

## The question format (8 points — the human decides in 30s without reading code)

1. **Context** — where the code is (`file:line`), what the function does. **If Context or any
   other point cites a spec/doc section (`§9.3`, "master-spec section X", a named policy
   doc), quote the literal referenced text inline — the actual sentence(s) from that
   section — not just the section number or name.** A section number alone forces the human
   to go dig up and read the source document themselves, which defeats the entire point of
   escalating in the strict format (a 30-second read, no repo access needed).
   - **Wrong:** "Per §9.3, the router fallback applies here." — the human now has to open
     the spec to check whether that's even true.
   - **Right:** "§9.3 states verbatim: '*When no explicit route matches, the entry-file
     fallback MUST activate before any error state is shown.*' — this means the fallback
     applies here because there's no explicit route for `/preview`."
   - If two sections conflict (the actual reason you're escalating a spec question at all),
     quote **both** verbatim side by side — don't paraphrase either one, and don't make the
     human reconcile them from memory of a summary.
2. **Glossary of terms and names** — every internal name (ticket, module, function,
   acronym, flag) explained in one phrase. The human is not obliged to remember your jargon.
   When writing in a language other than English (e.g. Russian), don't invent transliterated
   calques of English words — use the accepted native term, or the English word in Latin
   script with a one-phrase gloss on first use.
3. **Problem** — what concretely needs deciding (not abstractly).
4. **Options** — only ones that each have a real advantage. Each option gets **meaningful,
   reasonable pros / cons** — the kind that actually move the choice, not filler.
5. **Recommendation** — which option you think is right, and why.
6. **Where to look in the code** — the specific files and lines for a fast review.
7. **Screenshots** — if the problem is visual: BEFORE (the problem) + a description of the
   intended AFTER.
8. **Pseudocode for any non-trivial mechanism** — 3–7 lines of "before / after" instead of a
   paragraph of prose; a short snippet is clearer than the paragraph.

**More context is better than a question that can't be answered without opening the repo.**

### Machine-enforced by `tg` — send it as a STRUCTURED Rich Message

This is not a style suggestion any more: `tg --tag decision` and `tg --tag question` are
**deny-by-default** — `tg` BLOCKS the send (exit 1) and lists what's missing unless the body
carries the format above. It requires all of:

- **Options as a table, or a list of >=2 items** — the gate DOES enforce this structural
  shape, never a bare "which one?". Alongside it, **write pros/cons per option** — but the
  gate's pros/cons check is weaker than the structure check: it only confirms pros/cons
  *language appears somewhere* in the body, not that every option individually has one, so
  passing the gate is not proof you wrote a real per-option comparison. Telegram's HTML
  mode has no native `<table>` tag: an HTML `<table>` you write, or a markdown pipe grid
  (`| Option | Pros | Cons |`), is rendered by `tg` as a column-aligned monospace block inside
  `<pre>` — not a literal Telegram table widget, but it displays aligned and readable (it used
  to arrive as broken plain text).
- **Recommendation**, **Context** (a `file:line` + one line on what it does), and a
  **"where to look" `file:line`**.
- **STRUCTURE (readability)** — the reason an 8-point message can still be rejected: it must
  be a scannable Rich Message, **not a wall of text**. Each section under its own
  `<h3>`/`<h4>` heading; enumerations as short one-line `<ul>`/`<li>` items (**never** an
  inline comma-run like "pros: a, b, c"); `<hr>` dividers between sections; short lines.
  Send it with `--format html`.

Copy-pasteable good shape (see `tg help format` for the full GOOD-vs-BAD example):

```
tg --tag decision --format html '<h3>Context</h3><p>features/foo.ts:42 does X.</p><hr>
<h3>Options</h3><table><tr><th>Option</th><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr>
<tr><td>A</td><td>fast</td><td>risky</td></tr>
<tr><td>B</td><td>safe</td><td>slow</td></tr></table><hr>
<h3>Recommendation</h3><ul><li>A — faster, risk contained</li></ul><hr>
<h4>Where to look</h4><ul><li>features/foo.ts:42</li></ul>'
```

The ONE documented escape, for a genuine non-escalation / urgent edge case, is
`ESCALATION_GATE_ENFORCE=0` (downgrades the hard block to an advisory warning — it is a real,
named env var, so setting it in a shell profile or CI config does disable the gate for every
call in that environment; there is no other DOCUMENTED way to bypass it). Don't reach for
it to skip writing the format — it exists for the rare case the format genuinely doesn't fit.
The **shipped default** (in the `tg` binary itself, provisioned/kept current by `rig`) is ON —
a repo or agent has to actively set this named variable to turn it off, it never ships or
regresses to unenforced on its own.

This check is a heuristic floor (keyword/structure matching on free-form, often-Russian
text), not a semantic reviewer: it can be satisfied by a message that technically has all the
sections but is still a weak escalation. Meeting the gate is necessary, not sufficient — write
an actually good comparison, don't just clear the regex.

## Showing a child-repo diff: formatted Telegram text, NEVER a raw `.patch`

The hard case is a change **not in the main repo** the human reviews locally, but in a
**child / sibling project** — another repo, worktree, extension, or CLI utility. The human
does not have that code checked out and will not go hunting for it, least of all from a phone.
So:

- Generate an authoritative diff **from the child repo's branch worktree**, basing on the
  PR's *own* base (a hardcoded `origin/main` gives a wrong diff for a PR based on `develop`):
  ```sh
  BASE=$(gh pr view --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName)
  git diff "origin/$BASE...HEAD"   # three dots; more reliable than `gh pr diff <N>`
  ```
- **Send the diff as TEXT in the channel, nicely formatted — NEVER as a raw `tg --file
  <patch>`.** A `.patch` is unreadable on a phone. Use `tg --format html`, each diff chunk in
  a `<pre><code class="language-diff">…</code></pre>` block; long / secondary chunks in a
  `<blockquote expandable>`. Escape raw `<`, `>`, `&` inside the diff as `&lt;` `&gt;` `&amp;`.
- The channel caps a message near 4096 chars — **split by file / hunk** across messages.
  Send the mechanism core (production code) first; summarize large test diffs in a line
  rather than dumping them. Prefix each block with a "where to look" line: `file — purpose`.
- **A tool that EDITS someone else's code (not its own repo) — show the diff of the RESULT in
  the edited project.** If the feature is an extension/CLI that rewrites a target (user /
  fixture / child) project's files, the human checks **what was written into the target file**
  — not the tool's own diff. Capture the target file's `before → after` (grab it from the e2e
  run before the test restores the fixture) and confirm **no other files changed**
  (`git status` in the target project).
- **Mandatory `tg` bug workarounds (without these the diff send fails or arrives as garbage):**
  - Run `tg` from a **neutral cwd** (`cwd: /tmp`). `tg` auto-detects real file paths in the
    text and tries to send them as a media group (1024-char caption cap) → a diff (full of
    paths) fails with `400`. From `/tmp`, relative repo paths don't resolve → it goes as clean
    text.
  - Set `TG_AI_MODEL=claude` in the call's env — otherwise the auto-sender label emits garbage.
  - Keep each chunk **≤ ~3000 chars of raw body** (HTML-escaping `<`/`>`/`&` inflates length;
    leave headroom under 4096). Send sequentially, marked `(i/N)`.
- For the **main** repo (the human reviews it locally), a PR link + a per-item summary is
  enough — but if they ask to see the code, send it the same way: formatted text, not a file.

## "PR or drop" / "open a PR or close it" decisions

Never write just "need to: open a PR or drop". That's offloading the decision with no context.
A PR-or-drop request must state:

- What is concretely implemented (the functionality, not a file list).
- The linked ticket and its priority.
- Whether it's still relevant on the current roadmap (as far as code + history show).
- What's lost on drop (effort, uniqueness of the approach).
- The risks on merge (conflicts, regressions, test coverage).

## Common mistakes

- **Forwarding a quorum-settled question.** The models already agreed; you turned it into "A
  or B?" anyway. Implement and report, don't ask.
- **A grepable question.** "Does it deploy from main?" when one `grep` answers it. Self-check
  first.
- **A bare "which one?".** Options with no real pros/cons, no recommendation, no "where to
  look" — the human can't answer without opening the repo. That's a malformed request.
- **Risk-washing a feature.** Calling a normal product behavior a "vuln/leak/hazard" to force
  attention. Name the concrete harm, or don't call it a risk.
- **Raw `.patch` to the channel.** A file the human can't read on a phone. Send formatted diff
  text in chunks.
- **The orchestrator drafting its own request.** It cuts corners under load; delegate the
  drafting to a subagent that reads the spec/code.
- **Citing a spec section without quoting it.** "Per §9.3, X applies" makes the human choose
  between trusting your summary or going to read the spec themselves — either way the
  escalation failed its one job. Paste the literal sentence(s) from the section, every time.
- **Escalating "ship or hold" over review findings.** That routing is settled (fix on-scope
  findings in the PR; off-scope → follow-up ticket + ship). Apply the fixed rule, don't ask.

## Why

The whole point of escalation is that it's rare and high-signal. If the agent escalates
everything derivable, or sends bare "A or B?" questions, the human either becomes a bottleneck
or stops reading. A decision request that a quorum could have settled wastes a human round-trip;
one missing context wastes two (the question, then the "I need more info"). Decide what you can,
and when you genuinely can't, make the one escalation count.

Pairs with `adversarial-verification` (before you call a finding a "risk", construct the harm —
or admit there isn't one), `delegate-work-to-subagents` (the orchestrator dispatches the
request-drafting, it doesn't do it inline), and `queued-report-durability` (if the channel send
fails, surface it and re-queue — never silently treat the escalation as delivered).
