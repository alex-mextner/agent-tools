# Decide what you can; escalate only what you can't — and only in the strict format

Asking a human to decide is expensive and slow. Most "decisions" an agent wants to
escalate are not decisions at all — they're things derivable from the code, or things a
model quorum already agrees on. The reflex to forward "A or B?" upward is usually offloading
work the agent should have done. Escalate **only** the genuinely open product/architecture
calls, and when you do, send a self-contained request that the human can answer in 30
seconds **without opening the repo** — not a bare "which one?".

## When to escalate (and when NOT)

Escalate **only** product/architecture decisions that are **not derivable from the code**.

- **Don't recommend — decide.** If you already know the right option, or can find it out,
  don't hand the choice up. **Brainstorm first** across multiple models (`review brainstorm`
  / a debate-swarm / `review quorum`). **If the model quorum converges with confidence, that
  IS the decision: implement it autonomously and report finished code + rationale (citing the
  quorum) — not a question.** Escalate ONLY on a real model disagreement, or an irreversible
  decision with a large blast radius and no clear winner. Forwarding a question the quorum
  already settled, as "pick A or B", is a violation.
- **Never relabel a product feature as a "risk / vuln / hazard".** A write the tool itself
  makes (e.g. retargeting an i18n key) is a *feature*, not a danger. A user or team seeing
  *their own* project data (their keys, texts, sources) is not a "leak". Before you call
  something a risk, ask: *who exactly is harmed, and how?* If there's no answer, it's not a
  risk — and dressing a normal feature up as a security concern to force a human's attention
  is the violation this clause exists to stop.
- **The open-PR trigger.** Any mention of an open PR in the human's channel or the chat —
  even "waiting for review" in a status report — counts as a decision request and runs this
  protocol. A PR sitting open *is* a "merge or not" question; treat it as one.

## Decisions you must NOT escalate — the fixed-approach ones

Some "decisions" have a **fixed, standing answer** — the approach is already settled, so
there is nothing to escalate. Applying the rule IS the decision; forwarding it upward is the
violation. The canonical example is **where to fix code-review findings on a PR.**

**When a code review raises findings on a PR, WHERE to fix them is always decided the same
way — it is NEVER escalated to the human:**

- **Finding on this PR's own changed scope** (a defect in the lines / files this PR actually
  touches) → **fix it in this PR before merge.** This is the ONLY kind of finding that blocks
  the merge, and you fix it — you do not ask.
- **Finding NOT on this PR's scope** (a pre-existing issue, adjacent code, a different file, a
  larger refactor the review noticed in passing) → **address it NOW by creating a follow-up
  PR/ticket immediately**, with the finding written as that ticket's acceptance criteria and
  linked from the shipping PR. Then **this PR ships.** "Now" means at ship time — not a vague
  "someday", not a mental note. An off-scope finding never blocks the merge.
- Therefore **do NOT escalate "ship now vs hold vs fold it in" to the human.** Apply the rule
  and proceed autonomously.

This **supersedes** any blanket "never ship past a P1 without human sign-off" — but only for
findings that are **not on the PR's own scope**: an unrelated P1 → follow-up ticket + ship,
it does not block. Only a finding **on the PR's directly-changed scope** blocks the merge —
and that one you **fix**, you don't escalate. Severity (P1 / P2 / P3) sets the follow-up's
priority, not whether to escalate.

The general shape: **if a class of decision already has a written standing rule, the rule is
the answer** — decide by applying it, don't hand it up. Escalate only the genuinely-open
calls (below), never the ones already settled here.

## Self-check before ANY question — derive, don't ask

Anything verifiable, you verify yourself. **If the answer is one shell command, do not ask.**

- `git log`, `git diff --stat`, `grep`, `curl`, `cat`, `git merge-tree` — run them yourself.
- Examples that are NEVER a question: *does the landing deploy from main?* → `grep` the
  workflows. *Is function X in main?* → `grep`. *Will these branches conflict?* →
  `git merge-tree`. *Is this dep transitive?* → read the manifest.

A question whose answer you could have grepped in ten seconds is the most common form of this
failure. Run the check first.

## Consult before you escalate

Before sending anything upward, exhaust the cheaper advisors:

1. Consult a peer-model advisor / `review` panel (whatever your harness exposes — an
   `advisor()` tool for the main agent, `codex exec` review via a subagent, or the `claude`
   CLI for a codex-style agent). Save a non-trivial review to `docs/reviews/` and commit it.
   Tool access varies by *who* is asking, not just what's available: the main agent calls
   `advisor()` directly and runs a `review`/`codex exec` panel via a subagent; a background
   subagent has no session to hand `advisor()` (it isn't available there) but can run
   `codex exec` / `review` directly; a Codex-style agent has neither and instead shells out to
   the `claude` CLI. Route the consultation through whichever of these your current role
   actually has, don't skip the step because one specific tool is unavailable.
2. **The orchestrator does not post a decision request it drafted itself in passing.** A main
   agent juggling many tasks cuts corners — it ships a bare summary (options with no real
   pros/cons, no spec reference, no "where to look"). So the request is **drafted by a
   subagent** whose only job is to read the spec/code and assemble it strictly to the format
   below. This is a hard rule, not a preference.
3. **Self-check before sending** (any agent, every time): does the message have Context + a
   glossary of internal terms + Options with REAL pros/cons + a Recommendation + "where to
   look"? If even one is missing, it is malformed — do not send; rewrite it.
4. Only if the question is still open after all that — escalate.

## The channel: the human's out-of-band channel (mandatory)

Every decision request **must** go to the human's real channel (e.g. Telegram via the `tg`
CLI), in parallel with any chat post, immediately when it's formulated. The human does not
watch the agent's chat. "I'll remind them later" is not a channel.

**One consolidated list on request.** When the human asks "what are you waiting on me for" /
"all the open decisions", reply with a **single message listing ALL currently-open decisions**,
each in the format below (concrete question + options with real pros/cons + recommendation) —
not a vague category ("need to decide D1/D4/D5") and not scattered fragments. Keep it current:
mark resolved ones closed; don't re-list them as open.

## The question format (8 points — the human decides in 30s without reading code)

1. **Context** — where the code is (`file:line`), what the function does. **If Context or any
   other point cites a spec/doc section (`§9.3`, "master-spec section X", a named policy
   doc), quote the literal referenced text inline — the actual sentence(s) from that
   section — not just the section number or name.** A section number alone forces the human
   to go dig up and read the source document themselves, which defeats the entire point of
   escalating in the strict format (a 30-second read, no repo access needed).
   - **Wrong:** "Per §9.3, the router fallback applies here." — the human now has to open
     the spec to check whether that's even true.
   - **Right:** "§9.3 states verbatim: '*When no explicit route matches, the entry-file
     fallback MUST activate before any error state is shown.*' — this means the fallback
     applies here because there's no explicit route for `/preview`."
   - If two sections conflict (the actual reason you're escalating a spec question at all),
     quote **both** verbatim side by side — don't paraphrase either one, and don't make the
     human reconcile them from memory of a summary.
2. **Glossary of terms and names** — every internal name (ticket, module, function,
   acronym, flag) explained in one phrase. The human is not obliged to remember your jargon.
   When writing in a language other than English (e.g. Russian), don't invent transliterated
   calques of English words — use the accepted native term, or the English word in Latin
   script with a one-phrase gloss on first use.
3. **Problem** — what concretely needs deciding (not abstractly).
4. **Options** — only ones that each have a real advantage. Each option gets **meaningful,
   reasonable pros / cons** — the kind that actually move the choice, not filler.
5. **Recommendation** — which option you think is right, and why.
6. **Where to look in the code** — the specific files and lines for a fast review.
7. **Screenshots** — if the problem is visual: BEFORE (the problem) + a description of the
   intended AFTER.
8. **Pseudocode for any non-trivial mechanism** — 3–7 lines of "before / after" instead of a
   paragraph of prose; a short snippet is clearer than the paragraph.

**More context is better than a question that can't be answered without opening the repo.**

## Showing a child-repo diff: formatted Telegram text, NEVER a raw `.patch`

The hard case is a change **not in the main repo** the human reviews locally, but in a
**child / sibling project** — another repo, worktree, extension, or CLI utility. The human
does not have that code checked out and will not go hunting for it, least of all from a phone.
So:

- Generate an authoritative diff **from the child repo's branch worktree**, basing on the
  PR's *own* base (a hardcoded `origin/main` gives a wrong diff for a PR based on `develop`):
  ```sh
  BASE=$(gh pr view --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName)
  git diff "origin/$BASE...HEAD"   # three dots; more reliable than `gh pr diff <N>`
  ```
- **Send the diff as TEXT in the channel, nicely formatted — NEVER as a raw `tg --file
  <patch>`.** A `.patch` is unreadable on a phone. Use `tg --format html`, each diff chunk in
  a `<pre><code class="language-diff">…</code></pre>` block; long / secondary chunks in a
  `<blockquote expandable>`. Escape raw `<`, `>`, `&` inside the diff as `&lt;` `&gt;` `&amp;`.
- The channel caps a message near 4096 chars — **split by file / hunk** across messages.
  Send the mechanism core (production code) first; summarize large test diffs in a line
  rather than dumping them. Prefix each block with a "where to look" line: `file — purpose`.
- **A tool that EDITS someone else's code (not its own repo) — show the diff of the RESULT in
  the edited project.** If the feature is an extension/CLI that rewrites a target (user /
  fixture / child) project's files, the human checks **what was written into the target file**
  — not the tool's own diff. Capture the target file's `before → after` (grab it from the e2e
  run before the test restores the fixture) and confirm **no other files changed**
  (`git status` in the target project).
- **Mandatory `tg` bug workarounds (without these the diff send fails or arrives as garbage):**
  - Run `tg` from a **neutral cwd** (`cwd: /tmp`). `tg` auto-detects real file paths in the
    text and tries to send them as a media group (1024-char caption cap) → a diff (full of
    paths) fails with `400`. From `/tmp`, relative repo paths don't resolve → it goes as clean
    text.
  - Set `TG_AI_MODEL=claude` in the call's env — otherwise the auto-sender label emits garbage.
  - Keep each chunk **≤ ~3000 chars of raw body** (HTML-escaping `<`/`>`/`&` inflates length;
    leave headroom under 4096). Send sequentially, marked `(i/N)`.
- For the **main** repo (the human reviews it locally), a PR link + a per-item summary is
  enough — but if they ask to see the code, send it the same way: formatted text, not a file.

## "PR or drop" / "open a PR or close it" decisions

Never write just "need to: open a PR or drop". That's offloading the decision with no context.
A PR-or-drop request must state:

- What is concretely implemented (the functionality, not a file list).
- The linked ticket and its priority.
- Whether it's still relevant on the current roadmap (as far as code + history show).
- What's lost on drop (effort, uniqueness of the approach).
- The risks on merge (conflicts, regressions, test coverage).

## Common mistakes

- **Forwarding a quorum-settled question.** The models already agreed; you turned it into "A
  or B?" anyway. Implement and report, don't ask.
- **A grepable question.** "Does it deploy from main?" when one `grep` answers it. Self-check
  first.
- **A bare "which one?".** Options with no real pros/cons, no recommendation, no "where to
  look" — the human can't answer without opening the repo. That's a malformed request.
- **Risk-washing a feature.** Calling a normal product behavior a "vuln/leak/hazard" to force
  attention. Name the concrete harm, or don't call it a risk.
- **Raw `.patch` to the channel.** A file the human can't read on a phone. Send formatted diff
  text in chunks.
- **The orchestrator drafting its own request.** It cuts corners under load; delegate the
  drafting to a subagent that reads the spec/code.
- **Citing a spec section without quoting it.** "Per §9.3, X applies" makes the human choose
  between trusting your summary or going to read the spec themselves — either way the
  escalation failed its one job. Paste the literal sentence(s) from the section, every time.
- **Escalating "ship or hold" over review findings.** That routing is settled (fix on-scope
  findings in the PR; off-scope → follow-up ticket + ship). Apply the fixed rule, don't ask.

## Why

The whole point of escalation is that it's rare and high-signal. If the agent escalates
everything derivable, or sends bare "A or B?" questions, the human either becomes a bottleneck
or stops reading. A decision request that a quorum could have settled wastes a human round-trip;
one missing context wastes two (the question, then the "I need more info"). Decide what you can,
and when you genuinely can't, make the one escalation count.

Pairs with `adversarial-verification` (before you call a finding a "risk", construct the harm —
or admit there isn't one), `delegate-work-to-subagents` (the orchestrator dispatches the
request-drafting, it doesn't do it inline), and `queued-report-durability` (if the channel send
fails, surface it and re-queue — never silently treat the escalation as delivered).
