# anti-slop inside the Mextner TypeScript policy

Anti-slop is a specialized semantic layer inside the broader policy documented in [`../README.md`](../README.md). Do not consume it as a remote runtime dependency. `agent-tools` pins the reviewed fork at `vendor/anti-slop`; Rig vendors the supported asset tree from that pinned source into each target repository.

## Preferred repairs

When a rule fires, preserve evidence rather than suppressing the rule:

- keep inference rather than widening a known value — [preserve inference](../rules/preserve-inference.md);
- use `satisfies` when a value must satisfy a broader contract without replacing its inferred type;
- parse untrusted input once at the I/O boundary — [parse at boundaries](../rules/parse-at-boundaries.md);
- use discriminated unions or named owner contracts — [illegal states](../rules/make-illegal-states-unrepresentable.md);
- replace module mocking with real dependency seams and reflection with direct typed operations — [typed reflection](../rules/no-reflection-for-typed-code.md);
- remove unsafe assertions; if TypeScript cannot express a runtime-checked invariant, document that exact invariant with `SAFETY:` — [unsafe assertions](../rules/no-unsafe-assertions.md).

The anti-slop subrepo contains the authoritative per-rule guides for every anti-slop rule. Do not duplicate or fork those implementations inside agent-tools.

## Complete Oxc assertion baseline

Anti-slop catches important structural assertion/evidence patterns. Type-aware Oxlint supplies the general semantic net around them:

- `typescript/no-unsafe-type-assertion` — reject assertions that narrow the actual type;
- `typescript/no-unnecessary-type-assertion` — remove assertions that do not change the type;
- `typescript/no-non-null-assertion` — reject postfix `!`;
- `typescript/ban-ts-comment` — ban `@ts-ignore`/`@ts-nocheck` and require a description for `@ts-expect-error`.

Run Oxlint in type-aware mode and keep `tsc --noEmit` as a separate compiler gate. Use Oxfmt for formatting; Biome is not part of the provisioned JS/TS baseline.
