# Agent CLI Ecosystem — Roadmap

Status snapshot: **2026-06-16**. This is the handoff/roadmap for the agent-native CLI ecosystem
(`tg-cli`, `review-cli`, `rig-cli`, `draw-cli`, `3d-cli`, `task-cli`) + the `agent-tools` umbrella.

> **North-star architecture (DECIDED — do not re-litigate):** the whole CLI ecosystem is
> **Python-only**. `tg-cli` (currently Bun/TS) migrates to Python **LAST**. The shared
> `agent-tools/lib` is a **plain Python library** (NO `lib/ts`, NO cross-language contracts).
> New tools are built in Python on that lib so a new tool spins up fast on one architecture.
> `rig` is the front door (`rig init` onboarding, `rig apply` reconcile — two distinct commands,
> interactivity orthogonal). `agent-tools` = WHAT (the catalog), `rig` = HOW (installs it).

---

## ✅ Done (this session, 2026-06-15)

### review-cli

- ✅ **Modes → first-class SUBCOMMANDS** (`review review` default, `brainstorm`, `just-ask`,
  `quorum`; mode-registry plugin-dirs; `--brainstorm/--quorum/--just-ask` flags removed; bare
  `review -C <repo>` still defaults to diff-review; `--visual` stays a composable flag) — PR #23 **merged**.
- ✅ README reframed: visual review surfaced, spec-web/dashboard de-headlined → "spec-review
  tooling", removed agentic-marketing phrasing, ralphex comparison kept with two SVG diagrams.
- ✅ Dashboard `--host` Tailscale exposure + **live SSE** activity stream — PR #21 merged.
- ✅ Board: agentic codex seat (GPT-5.5 = codex); Kimi-K2.7-Code on board; pool=4 default.
- ✅ Ecosystem doc migration: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` + `review install-skill` regenerated to subcommand syntax.

### tg-cli

- ✅ `tg replies [user|agent|all] [list|find]` — recall session messages (history.jsonl) — PR #24 merged.
- ✅ Inbound media download retry-with-backoff — PR #22 merged.
- ✅ README orthogonality: branding-follows-model (not opencode-specific), detection precedence,
  3-axis comparison — PR #23 merged.

### rig-cli

- ✅ `rig init` onboarding front door + `rig apply` reconcile + auto-mode harness provisioning
  (writes `permissions.defaultMode`) — PR #3 merged. Installed + verified (doctor green).
- ✅ Global layer applied machine-wide (47 skills → ~/.agents/skills, 7 agent-hooks, git-dispatcher, ship, mcp).

### agent-tools

- ✅ README reframed around rig front door + 4 pillars (autonomous/observable/controllable/safe).
- ✅ New agent-hook `block-raw-pr-merge` (forces `gh ship`, escape-hatch) — PR #8 merged.
- ✅ Shared-lib architecture **design doc** at `docs/specs/2026-06-15-shared-lib-architecture.md`
  (NOTE: its `lib/ts`/contracts-twinning part is SUPERSEDED — Python-only).
- ✅ **Auto-mode provisioned + made AUTOMATIC (self-dogfood)** — committed `rig.yaml`
  (`harness.auto_mode: true`) AND committed `.claude/settings.json` (`bypassPermissions`). Reversed an
  earlier wrong call: `.claude/settings.json` is Claude Code's SHARED/committed slot, so committing it is
  what makes auto-mode turn on by itself on a fresh checkout (gitignoring it was the reason it "didn't
  turn on" — CTO caught this). Only `.claude/settings.local.json` (the personal slot) stays gitignored.
  Matches the rig-cli reference. ⚠️ Safety caveat: the "safe because agent-hooks intercept" rationale is
  bridge-pending — CC-level guards are INERT until the #18 hook-bridge lands + is live-verified.
- ✅ **CI gates de-GHAS'd (PR #23 merged)** — the rig-shipped gates depended on PAID GitHub features and
  hard-failed on the hyper org/private repo. Dropped them for free OSS engines (CTO call, tg#3774):
  `secret-scan.yml` → gitleaks **OSS binary** (`gitleaks dir`; same engine+ruleset, no org license, vs the
  `gitleaks-action` that demands a paid `GITLEAKS_LICENSE`); `dependency-review.yml` → scripted
  `dep-audit.sh` (whole-tree bun/npm/pip/cargo/go audit, no GHAS, vs `dependency-review-action` that needs
  GHAS on private repos). READMEs corrected (the old "GHAS only for the dashboard" claim was wrong). Verified
  parity (tg#3777): secrets 1:1, vulns equal-or-better; **one gap = license-policy → #21**. CodeQL
  actions-suppressions in the leftover-grep/review-threads templates were already correct (untouched).

### hyper #463 (rig-rollout PR) — how it goes green

- The 3 red checks on #463 were all from the GHAS/licensed gates above; **PR #23 fixes them at the source**.
  #463 goes green when the **rig agent re-applies `rig apply`** (pulls the #23 templates + commits auto-mode in
  one pass) — owned by the parallel rig agent, NOT hand-edited on the #463 branch (two agents, one branch =
  collision). The CodeQL-actions red on #463 is a stale rollout copy → the re-apply replaces it.
- ⚠️ **Separate REAL finding (pre-existing, not the rollout):** hyper's OWN `security-scan.yml` "Dependency
  Audit" flags a genuine high vuln — **esbuild `^0.25` (GHSA-gv7w-rqvm-qjhr**, RCE via Deno install path; not
  exploitable on Node/bun). Bump or waive with justification — tracked as **HYP-743** (Linear).

### ➡️ DELEGATED to the rig agent — finish the hyper rollout (CTO tg#3783/#3784)

The parallel rig agent owns completing hyper's rollout; this session hands it off:

1. **`rig apply` re-run on hyper** → pulls the #23 templates (de-GHAS'd gates) + commits auto-mode → greens #463
   (replaces the stale CodeQL-actions copy too).
2. **Remove hyper's bespoke `security-scan.yml`** (CTO: common gates belong in agent-tools, not per-repo).
   Coverage parity BEFORE deleting — its three jobs: **Semgrep** ✅ covered by agent-tools `ci/sast/`;
   **bun audit** ✅ covered by `ci/dependency-review/dep-audit.sh` (#23); **Trivy** ❌ **NO agent-tools
   equivalent yet** → either add a `ci/trivy/` (or fs-scan) gate to agent-tools and provision via rig, or
   keep hyper's Trivy step. Don't silently drop Trivy. Tracked: **agent-tools #24**.
3. **esbuild HYP-743** must be bumped/waived for any whole-tree dep-audit (rig's or hyper's) to pass green.

### ecosystem hygiene

- ✅ ralphex/quorex removed everywhere + `alex-mextner/quorex` **archived** with a "superseded by
  review-cli" banner; 3d-cli docs purged; hyper-saas AGENTS.md ralphex workflow removed (PR #461 merged).
- ✅ hyperide.ai homepage URL cleared on all 6 tool repos.

---

## ✅ Done (2026-06-16) — auto-mode SAFETY BLOCKER CLOSED + 17 PRs landed

*(The detail below lists the first 9; the §3 lib stack #30/#33/#17, this roadmap #40, rig-cli #18, and the
3 cross-repo doc PRs (review #27, draw #4, 3d #7) landed later the same session — see "Next actions".)*

### 🎯 Auto-mode guard — RESOLVED (the central "bridge-pending safety" blocker is CLOSED)

- **#20 hook-bridge MERGED** (`d4ff40f`) + hardened (timeout_ms null/bool/0/neg; non-UTF-8 decode
  pinned `errors=replace`/`encoding=utf-8`; NotebookEdit path normalized so pre-write guards scope it).
- **`rig apply` wired `cc_hook_bridge` into `~/.claude/settings.json`** (3 dispatcher hooks:
  PreToolUse×2 + Stop). **Live-proven THIS machine:** a blockable cmd → `permissionDecision: deny`,
  benign → allow. So `defaultMode: auto` is now GUARDED — the installed agent-hooks (block-secrets-write,
  enforce-timeout-on-bash, require-review-before-commit, block-no-verify, block-raw-pr-merge, …) actually
  FIRE under auto-mode. The roadmap's "safe pillar is bridge-pending" caveat is now satisfied.
- Provisioned via rig (dogfood), not hand-edits.

### Merged this session (gh ship, gated — green CI + resolved codex threads)

- **agent-tools #38** — NEW `ci/tests` slot (pytest via uv, secretless) + rig provisions it. agent-tools had
  12 governance CI slots but none that RAN the repo's tests → `gh ship` refused no-CI PRs. This unblocked the
  whole backlog. Keystone.
- **agent-tools #29** — `lib/agenttools_retry` (§3 "retry"). **agent-tools #32** — mcp-policy (review is a
  CLI+skill, NOT an MCP; removed the dead `mcp/review` slot + repointed 6 dangling refs). **agent-tools #34**
  — third-party tool triage (#19). **agent-tools #35** — strict-ticket-discipline skill + require-ticket
  hook (task-cli integration piece; fixed 2 real hook bugs: honor `git -C`, don't exempt on flags in the msg).
- **rig-cli #21** — NEW `rig stats show`: tool-adoption analytics across agent harnesses (sources/aggregate/
  render pipeline, json/tui/web). Fixed 2 P2 (parse_iso non-string; inverted --since/--until).
- **review-cli #28 + #29** — spec-web phase-1 (mobile UX) + phase-2 (submit→agent handoff, debounced disk
  drafts, `review spec-web reply` → UI+tg). §7 review-cli follow-ups. (Caught a CI regression the building
  agent's subset-test run missed — `--spec` in `_VALUE_TAKING_OPTS` broke a guard test.)

### Durable / infra

- Global `~/.gitignore` now ignores `.serena/` + `.claude/worktrees/` (machine artifacts were tripping
  `gh ship`'s clean-worktree check — not a ship bug; ship works fine from clean worktrees, verified).
- `gh ship` (ci/ship/ship.sh) confirmed repo-agnostic: ran it against rig-cli/review-cli via `bash
  <agent-tools>/ci/ship/ship.sh <PR>` from each repo's worktree.

### Still-open in §3 (Shared lib extraction) — handed off with documented threads

- **#30 lib-config** (§3 "config") — rebased onto main, conflict resolved, 30 tests pass (with pyyaml). **2
  open P2:** (1) `core.py` "global-only" mode still loads the repo layer (no suppress) — needs an API knob +
  test; (2) ⚠️ **SYSTEMIC:** umbrella `lib/pyproject.toml` builds only `agenttools_log`
  (`include=["agenttools_log*"]`), so NO new lib module installs — fix ONCE for all (`#29 lib-retry` already
  merged with this latent gap).
- **#33 lib-advertise** (§3 "advertise") + **#17 format-hook** — CONFLICTING; need rebase (lib/README.md row
  conflict, same as #30) + thread resolution.
- **Uncommitted lib modules** in `.claude/worktrees/wf_9d942e4d-*`: `tmux_inject` (§3 "tmux-inject"),
  `daemon` (§3 "daemon-supervisor"), `registry` (§3 "registry"); `gantt`/`providers` committed → need push+PR.

### New tickets opened (add to ledger)

- **agent-tools #39** — surface advisory (exit-0) v1 hook messages as CC `additionalContext` (bridge follow-up).
- **review-cli #30** — spec-web draft autosave race → server-side ordering token/tombstone.

## 🎯 Next actions — audit-reconciled 2026-06-16 (ordered; drives the loop)

*Live cross-repo audit of all 7 tool repos (roadmap-state-audit workflow). Re-audit (or `gh pr view`)
before acting — items 1–4 + 6's #18 LANDED later in this same 2026-06-16 session.*

1. ✅ **DONE — Easy wins:** review-cli **#27**, draw-cli **#4**, 3d-cli **#7** MERGED; review-cli **#26**
   closed. PENDING: tg-cli **#33** (no local checkout — clone tg-cli first), 3d-cli **#1** (blocked on a
   required check — re-check).
2. ✅ **DONE — Cleanup:** agent-tools **#18** closed (bridge done, pointed at `d4ff40f`); rig-cli **#12**
   was already merged.
3. ✅ **INVESTIGATED — not a hard blocker:** the lib modules DO install via their NESTED pyproject
   (`uv --with .../lib/agenttools_config` — verified). The umbrella `lib/pyproject.toml` is just
   agenttools_log's own dist; the real fix is per-module README install paths (done in #30). No packaging
   refactor needed. (Optional polish: clarify the misleadingly-named root pyproject.)
4. ✅ **DONE (PRs) — §3 lib stack:** **#30** lib-config, **#33** lib-advertise, **#17** format-hook ALL
   MERGED (each had REAL codex P2s — global-only, symlink-write-through, ruff-in-Black-repo — fixed+tested).
   ⏳ STILL TODO: **proper commit+push+PR** the 3 uncommitted modules (tmux_inject/daemon/registry) — they are
   **backed up** at `~/xp/agent-tools-lib-modules-backup-2026-06-16/` (loss risk gone) but NOT yet in git;
   plus PR the committed gantt/providers. Do BEFORE any `git worktree prune` of `wf_9d942e4d-*`.
5. **tg-cli (S):** ship #34 (autolink → tg#28) and #35 (defer-while-waiting → tg#30) after clearing 1 thread each. (No local tg-cli checkout — clone first.)
6. **rig-cli:** ✅ **#18** (readme) MERGED. ⏳ **#20** (`rig config get|set`, §5 piece) — has a real P2 (validate
   the GLOBAL layer in isolation so a repo overlay can't mask a bad `--global` write; fix verified-viable: an
   empty-cwd `_load_plan` sees only the global layer) + a `docs/gen_svgs.py` rebase conflict to resolve.
7. **rig-cli §5 (L):** repo-settings provisioning via `gh api` + `agent-browser` (current branch
   `roadmap-rig-repo-settings`). Guard with capability detection (org/private repos can hard-fail on
   ruleset/GHAS endpoints — same class that forced the GHAS→OSS retreat); default-on only where the API permits.

### ➡️ rig-tooling session (2026-06-15) — RESUME HERE

- **hook-bridge #18 LIVE-CC VERIFIED** ✅ — fresh `claude -p` under `bypassPermissions`: a raw
  `gh pr merge` → CC `permissionDecision: deny` (bridge → block-raw-pr-merge), a benign cmd → pass.
  The "live-CC round-trip" the bridge section flags as pending is **done**. #20's conflict with main is
  resolved + pushed (branch `cc-hooks-bridge`). **Land #20 then #12.**
- **Auto-mode finding: `auto` > `bypassPermissions`, and `auto` is USER-level ONLY** — CC silently ignores
  `defaultMode:auto` in a repo's project/local `.claude/settings.json` (since v2.1.142; confirmed empirically
  on 2.1.177), honoring it only from `~/.claude/settings.json`. `auto` (research preview) auto-approves WITH a
  safety classifier; bypass skips everything. So the committed-per-repo bypass rollout is the inferior model
  AND project-bypass overrides user-auto. Redesign: `docs/specs/2026-06-15-harness-layer-redesign.md` (PR #25)
  — CC → user-level `auto`, migrate the 6 tool repos off committed project bypass, per-harness branch-on-kind.
- **Open PRs:** **#25** (harness-redesign spec), **#26** (this rig-config-UX capture: config get/set, schema,
  symlinks, repo-settings), **#20** + **rig-cli #12** (the verified bridge). agent-tools `main` is now
  branch-protected → PRs only (the `gh ship` script `.claude/scripts/pr-ship.sh` was missing here — fix it).
- **Pending impl:** delete `rig setup` alias (CTO); implement the #26-captured rig features; verify tg
  `PermissionRequest` passthrough fires in `auto` mode (tg-ctl already installs the hook).
- **⚠️ `/Users/ultra/work/hyper-canvas-draft` auto-mode STILL DOES NOT WORK (CTO confirmed 2026-06-15).**
  Diagnosed: its committed `.claude/settings.json` + `.claude/settings.local.json` set **no `defaultMode` at
  all** (the huge `permissions.allow` list is auto-accumulated "always allow", not auto-mode). And `auto`
  can't be project-committed (user-level only), so the real fix is **user-level `auto`** (or the rig harness
  migration), provisioned by **rig** — NOT a hand-edit (a manual settings.local.json edit was made then
  reverted per "fix tooling, not manual"). Close it via the rig harness redesign + the hyper rollout
  (delegated to the rig agent). It's a TEAM product repo → user-level auto for Alex, don't commit bypass to
  the org repo.
- task-cli foundation (agent a9cef4ca) — building the Python tool in the new `alex-mextner/task-cli`
  repo per `task-cli/docs/2026-06-15-task-cli-spec.md`. Check the repo for the pushed branch/PR.
- **model-currency** (agent a48e44ab) — building `lib/contracts/models.yaml` (→ relocate to a
  Python `lib/` path, no contracts dir needed) + `lib/checker/model_freshness.py` + rig daily-noon
  cron provisioning. Check agent-tools + rig-cli for its PRs.
- **CI-gate resilience** — DONE: agent-tools **PR #9** (gate templates degrade gracefully); wave-1
  rollout PRs patched green except tg-cli #25 CodeQL.

## 📋 Open PRs ready to land

- agent-tools **#9** — CI gate resilience — **MERGED**.
- rollout: draw-cli **#3** — **MERGED**; 3d-cli **#6** — **MERGED**; rig-cli **#4** (model-cron
  schedule) — **MERGED** (gitleaks GITHUB_TOKEN fix + 2 codex review findings resolved).
- **tg-cli #25** (rig rollout) — **MERGED** with a documented justification: it is infra-only
  (CI workflows + `ci/` companions + AGENTS.md + rig.yaml), touches no `features/**` source, and the
  CodeQL JS/TS self-gate's only red was **8 pre-existing findings** in untouched `features/**` code
  (the gate firing on legacy code, not a regression). Those are tracked for a real fix-or-justify at
  alex-mextner/tg-cli#31 — NOT mass-suppressed; the self-gate goes green on main once #31 lands.

## 🗺️ Remaining work (prioritized)

### 1. task-cli (after foundation lands)

- **Phase 1** (foundation, in-flight): Python CLI — backends (GitHub Issues default, Linear per-repo)
  call the provider **API directly** with creds harvested from `gh`/`linear` configs; classification
  `change|justAsk` via `review just-ask` per-provider fallback chain (haiku head); enforcement gates
  (acceptance criteria / motivation / user-impact / cost-of-inaction / screenshots / formatting, each
  with `--skip-<gate> "<reason>"` escape hatch); `list` defaults to this-session tickets.
- **Phase 2** (#3695): task **dependency system** + **Gantt** rendering (alex-mextner/task-cli#1); a
  **daemon service** (like tg-ctl: first call brings it up, survives restarts/kills, subscribes to
  gh-issues/Linear **webhooks**, **adapter-based** for future trackers) (alex-mextner/task-cli#2); on
  completion → inject "done, X unblocked" into the agent's tmux pane (via shared-lib tmux-inject);
  **due-date** reminders to the agent (alex-mextner/task-cli#3); task-cli self-hook.
- **Integrations** (alex-mextner/task-cli#4): tg-cli classify inbound hook (#3645); agent-tools
  `strict-ticket-discipline` skill + `require-ticket-before-commit` guard (+ optional
  `ci/ticket-required`); rig provisioning (installs linear-cli when backend=linear, for auth only).
  Needs a NEW `on-inbound` hook point in `agents-hooks/v1`.

### 2. tg-cli `/tasks` (after task-cli)

- `/tasks` → table + Gantt + agent summary for the session's tasks; show external-to-session deps;
  diagram sent **HD inline** (not as a file, uncompressed-quality). (alex-mextner/tg-cli#26)

### 3. Shared lib extraction (Python-only) — `agent-tools/lib/<module>`

Tracking issue: alex-mextner/agent-tools#12. Per the design doc; phased, lowest-churn first. Each
tool migrates to import from the lib.

1. **`advertise`** (install-skill — 4 copies today) — first extraction, stands up the skeleton.
2. **`hooks`** (`agents-hooks/v1` dispatcher; tg vendored it — de-dupe).
3. **`providers`** (the biggest asset: board, failover, transports, `oc:` routing, key cascade,
   **capability tags incl. vision-filter for `--visual`**, **model-currency manifest**). Consumed by
   review, task-cli classifier, research-cli.
4. **`config`** (cascade + env precedence + `~/.config` paths).
5. **`registry` + trust-kernel** (the hook-trust + visual-module-registry trust algorithm, one place).
6. **`retry`** (net-new), **`tmux-inject`** (extract from tg-ctl), **daemon-supervisor**
   (survives kills — shared by task-cli + tg-ctl), **Gantt-render**, `agenttools_log` (exists).

### 4. model-currency (in-flight → finish)

- `models.yaml` manifest: per-provider current model + **capability tags** (vision/code/reasoning) +
  role aliases (role `vision` resolves only to vision-capable). Daily-noon **cron checker** that polls
  provider `/models` and opens a bump PR (semi-auto). rig provisions the schedule (launchd/cron),
  check-and-install-if-missing at init/apply. (alex-mextner/rig-cli#8 — rig cron provisioning landed
  in PR #4, merged.)

### 5. rig

- **rig provisions REPOSITORY SETTINGS at init/apply** (config-driven, sensible defaults ON) (#3696/#85,
  CTO 2026-06-15): rig.yaml declares the repo's GitHub settings and `rig init`/`rig apply` reconciles them,
  the same way it does skills/hooks/CI. **Two backends, auto-selected per setting:**
  - **`gh api`** for everything the GitHub API exposes: **branch protection / rulesets** (require-PR,
    required status checks + reviews, linear history, block force-push — the `…/settings/rules/` the CTO
    just enabled by hand), **GHAS** (Dependency Graph + vuln-alerts + secret-scanning + code-scanning),
    merge-button policy (squash-only, auto-delete head branch, auto-merge), Actions permissions, etc.
  - **`agent-browser`** for settings the API does NOT expose — drive the GitHub settings UI headlessly to
    flip the switches `gh api` can't reach. A first-class rig backend invoked INSIDE init/apply, not a
    manual step.
  Everything maps onto rig.yaml (a `repo:`/`github:` block) with the **secure/sensible set enabled by
  default**, so a fresh `rig init` lands the guardrails (branch protection + GHAS + squash-merge + ship gate)
  with zero hand-toggling. `rig status` reports drift on these like any other managed artifact. (Supersedes
  the narrow "gh api enable Dependency Graph" scope.) (alex-mextner/rig-cli#5)
- **`rig config get|set [--global] <path> [val]` — the recommended way to change config** (CTO 2026-06-15):
  read/write a single nested key in `rig.yaml` (or `~/.config/rig/config.yaml` with `--global`) WITHOUT
  hand-editing YAML, and **reconcile immediately** — `set` runs `rig apply` so the change takes effect on the
  spot. `<path>` is dot-notation into the YAML tree (`harness.mode`, `ci.items.secret-scan.tier`,
  `github.branch_protection.required_reviews`). The tooling-driven config-change UX: agents and the CTO change
  rig config through `rig config set`, never by hand-patching the file. (Pairs with the repo-settings
  provisioning above + the harness-layer redesign + the "fix tooling, not manual" rule.)
- **rig.yaml has a real, ENFORCED JSON schema + config docs in the rig repo** (CTO 2026-06-15): ship a JSON
  Schema for `rig.yaml` + the global config and actually VALIDATE against it (not just prose) — `rig apply` /
  `rig config set` reject an unknown key or bad value with a clear error + the schema path, and editors get
  completion/validation. The human-readable config reference (`docs/config-schema.md`, already cited from the
  rig.yaml header) must EXIST in rig-cli and stay in sync with the schema (one source of truth, every key
  documented). "It should work" = a malformed config fails loudly, not silently.
- **rig always provisions `AGENTS.md` + `CLAUDE.md` as symlinks** (CTO 2026-06-15): a repo should carry BOTH
  files so every harness finds its expected name (codex/opencode/gemini read `AGENTS.md`, Claude Code reads
  `CLAUDE.md`), pointing at ONE source of truth via a symlink (e.g. `CLAUDE.md` → `AGENTS.md`) so the two can
  never drift. `rig init`/`rig apply` create/repair the symlink (never clobber a real file without backup);
  `rig status` flags a missing or broken link.
- **Auto-mode is COMMITTED** (decision REVERSED 2026-06-15, CTO): `.claude/settings.json` is Claude
  Code's SHARED/committed slot — committing it (`defaultMode: bypassPermissions`) is what makes auto-mode
  turn on by itself on every checkout. The personal per-machine slot is `.claude/settings.local.json`
  (that one stays gitignored). rig-cli#6 ("gitignore settings.json") is REVERSED/wontfix — the opposite is
  correct. ⚠️ The footgun every reviewer flagged: committed `bypassPermissions` auto-accepts every tool
  call on any LOCAL CLI checkout (web sessions ignore it), and the agent-hooks that would gate it are
  INERT in CC until the #18 bridge lands + is live-verified. So the "safe" pillar is bridge-pending —
  #18 is now a HARD blocker for blessing auto-mode, not a nicety. (alex-mextner/rig-cli#6 — reverse it.)
- **Rollout (#3686)**: wave-1 tool repos = PRs open (draw/3d green, tg pending TS fix). **Wave-2 =
  bots** (ExpenseSyncBot, garage-band, summary-bot, esphome-ir, claude-p, diploma, sme-archiving-gc,
  talks, upwork) + review-cli/rig-cli/agent-tools themselves. Each: `rig init --yes` + conservative
  AGENTS/CLAUDE slim (drop now-self-advertised generic rules, keep project specifics) + harvest report.
  (alex-mextner/rig-cli#7)
  - **Auto-mode COMMITTED-settings.json status (on `origin/main`, 2026-06-15):** rig-cli ✅, agent-tools ✅,
    review-cli ✅, task-cli ✅, draw-cli ✅, 3d-cli ✅ — all six Python tool repos now COMMIT
    `.claude/settings.json`. draw/3d had `.claude/` blanket-gitignored (the old "keep local" call) — that
    was the ecosystem-wide cause of "auto didn't turn on"; reversed (narrowed to `settings.local.json`).
    **tg-cli** is Bun/TS → migrates to Python last; provision then. ⚠️ The rig.yaml
    `mcp.review.command: "review --mcp"` is STALE (the `--mcp` flag was dropped in the review subcommand
    refactor; the global `~/.claude/mcp/mcp.json` registration is broken too) — fix-or-remove before any
    `rig apply` registers a dead MCP server (tracked in §9 misc).

### 5b. rig manages tmux configuration (CTO 2026-06-16)

`.tmux.conf` + plugin setup (tpm/resurrect/continuum) become rig-managed artifacts, reconciled like
skills/hooks/CI — not hand-edited dotfiles that drift. Requirements surfaced while fixing a stale-session
reboot (continuum's last save was 3 weeks old):

- **Apply mechanism = import-preferred, managed-block fallback (CTO 2026-06-16).** rig must MIGRATE an
  existing hand-written `~/.tmux.conf`, not clobber it. Preferred: rig owns a generated file (e.g.
  `~/.config/rig/tmux/rig.tmux.conf`) built declaratively from rig.yaml, and `~/.tmux.conf` carries a
  single `source-file <that path>` import; rig rewrites its own file wholesale on every `rig apply`
  (idempotent) and never touches the user's hand-written lines. Fallback (when an import is undesirable):
  splice a managed block between sentinel markers (`# === rig-managed (tmux) BEGIN ===` / `… END ===`)
  and replace ONLY between the markers (conda-init style). First apply: detect rig-owned settings already
  inline (resurrect/continuum/Moshi/etc.), lift them into the import/block, back up the original
  (`~/.tmux.conf.rig-bak`), leave user-specific lines intact. `rig status` reports drift on the managed
  region only. Because rig generates the managed region, it can GUARANTEE ordering (continuum's
  status-right hook last — the root cause of the stale-session bug) instead of relying on hand-ordering.
- **Moshi-specific tmux tweaks must be SEPARATELY toggled (opt-in), not unconditional.** Current bug:
  `set -g status-right ''` under `$MOSHI_CLIENT` wipes tmux-continuum's autosave timer (it lives in
  `status-right`) → continuum silently stops saving → a reboot restores a weeks-stale session. Moshi
  tweaks must gate behind an explicit enable and must never break continuum/resurrect (use a Moshi-safe
  status layout that keeps continuum's hook, or move continuum off status-right).
- **resurrect must restart Claude Code per-window with the right session id.** `@resurrect-processes`
  has no `claude` today, so cc is not restored at all after a reboot. Need `claude` in the list PLUS a
  save/restore hook that records each window's cwd→cc session id and relaunches `claude --continue`
  (most-recent in cwd) or `claude --resume <id>` (exact) after restore.
- **tmux must auto-come-up after a machine reboot** — verify continuum-boot / a launchd agent actually
  fires (currently `@continuum-boot on` + `boot-options iterm`, unverified), don't assume.
- **reconnect must attach to the ONE session, not spawn a new one (anti-sprawl).** Observed: a Moshi/iTerm
  reconnect created a duplicate session ("3" alongside the working "2", same `ext` window) instead of
  re-attaching — the user reads this as "tmux crashed again". The login/reconnect entry must do
  attach-or-create (`tmux attach -t main || tmux new -s main`), single canonical session. Note there are
  TWO tmux wrappers in play (`tmux` with `.tmux.conf` + `ln` with `.ln.conf`) — reconcile/clarify which is
  the canonical one so they don't fight.

### 6. research-cli (after lib `providers`)

- Separate Python CLI on the shared lib's panel engine (NOT a review mode). Reuses providers verbatim.
  (alex-mextner/agent-tools#13)

### 7. review-cli follow-ups

- #75: make ALL board models agentic via opencode (re-investigate commandcode + GLM custom provider).
  (alex-mextner/review-cli#24)
- Fix flat `DEFAULT_MODELS` stale `kimi-k2p6-turbo` via Fireworks (dead `glide` account) → manifest.
  (alex-mextner/review-cli#25)
- Propagate canonical ecosystem one-liner to other repos' ecosystem tables (after their rollout PRs):
  *"multi-model read-only code review from one command: diff review, cited quorum, brainstorm, visual
  review, and interactive spec-review tooling. Read-only, CLI-first, harness-agnostic."*
  (alex-mextner/review-cli#26)

### 8. agent-tools harvest (one centralized pass, from rollout reports)

Tracking issue: alex-mextner/agent-tools#14.

- Candidate skills (Sources: 3d-cli AGENTS):
  - ✅ **worktree-via-project-cli** (dep provisioning, distinct from worktree-base-trap) — authored
    (`skills/universal/`), GREEN-verified per writing-skills.
  - ✅ **queued-report-durability** (channel-unavailable → don't fake delivery) — authored, GREEN-verified.
  - ⏭️ **subagent-delegation contract** — SKIPPED: already covered by `subagent-handoff-contract` (dupe).
  - ⏭️ **"diagnostic image ≠ proof" acceptance bar** — SKIPPED: overlaps `visual-proof-cycle`; fold a
    proof-claim acceptance-bar note into that skill rather than ship a near-duplicate.
- `strict-ticket-discipline` skill + `require-ticket-before-commit` guard (with task-cli).

### 9. Misc / cleanup

- **PREREQUISITE for ALL AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md slimming — skills must actually LOAD** (tg#3736/3740,
  rig-cli#9): the harness discovers Skill-tool skills from `~/.claude/skills/` (symlinks → ~/.agents/skills),
  NOT from ~/.agents/skills directly. rig installed to ~/.agents/skills but never symlinked into
  ~/.claude/skills → rig-installed universal skills were NOT loaded → "self-advertised via skill" was
  FALSE. **✅ DURABLE FIX LANDED (2026-06-15): rig-cli PR #11 (`link_skill_harness`) MERGED** — `rig apply`
  idempotently symlinks each enabled skill into the harness discovery dir (claude-code → ~/.claude/skills),
  harness-keyed via `harness.kind`, never clobbers real non-symlink dirs, `rig status` reports link drift.
  **Verified post-merge: 56 entries in ~/.claude/skills, 53 symlinks all resolve (0 broken SKILL.md), 3
  real hand-authored dirs untouched.** So the **cc** harness is DONE + reproducible for any machine.
  **STILL OPEN — must work for ALL supported harnesses** (tg#3747), each with its own discovery mechanism:
  cc → `~/.claude/skills` (dir-skills); codex → `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`; opencode (oc) → `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`;
  gemini → `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`; commandcode (cmd) → has its own agent CLI (CONFIRMED by CTO) — provision its global instruction dir;
  pi → **earendil-works/pi** (github.com/earendil-works/pi, the minimal extensible coding-agent harness; loads AGENTS.md, multi-provider) → AGENTS.md-style provisioning like codex/oc (confirm its global dir at impl). The **supported-harness list must be in the README** (agent-tools + rig).
- **⚠️ agent-hooks don't FIRE in Claude Code — need an agents-hooks/v1 → CC bridge** (agent-tools#18): CC runs settings.json hooks (PreToolUse/PostToolUse), NOT the ~/.claude/hooks/*.json `agents-hooks/v1` descriptors rig installs → block-raw-pr-merge / block-secrets / format-on-write / etc. are ALL INERT in CC (files nothing invokes). The 'safe because guards intercept' pillar is FALSE until a bridge runner is wired into settings.json (rig-installed, harness-keyed) + verified by the clean-room e2e. Same class as the skill-loading gap. DO NOT claim any guard 'works' in CC until this lands.
  **✅ BUILT (2026-06-15) — NOT merged:** **agent-tools PR #20** (dispatcher `lib/cc_hook_bridge`: reads CC's
  tool-call JSON, maps `(event,tool)`→v1 point, runs the `~/.claude/hooks/*.json` descriptors, translates
  exit-10 BLOCK → CC's `permissionDecision: deny` on exit 0 — contract confirmed against installed CC 2.1.177)
  - **rig-cli PR #12** (`register_hook_bridge` wires it into settings.json PreToolUse/PostToolUse on `rig apply`).
  Clean-room test PROVES it: raw `gh pr merge` → DENY, `gh ship` → pass.
  **➡️ NEXT ACTION (DO THIS before merging): live-CC round-trip verification.** The clean-room proof drives the
  dispatcher exactly as CC invokes it, but it was NOT run inside a live CC session. To close the loop: in a
  real CC session run `rig apply` (so `register_hook_bridge` writes the settings.json hooks), then trigger a
  guarded action (a raw `gh pr merge`) and confirm **CC itself refuses the tool call**; confirm a benign
  action passes. THEN merge **#20 first, then #12** (interdependent). Until that live round-trip passes, the
  "safe because guards intercept" pillar stays UNPROVEN — do not claim any guard "works" in CC, do not merge.
- **Clean-room / Docker e2e for rig** (tg#3745, rig-cli#10): the manual symlink fixed THIS machine; only a
  fresh-environment e2e (Docker container or throwaway `$HOME`) running `rig init` as a brand-new user
  proves it works for ANYONE on ANY machine — assert skills discoverable by the harness (~/.claude/skills
  resolve + in the Skill-tool list), hooks/dispatcher/CI/auto-mode installed, idempotent re-apply,
  `rig status` clean. (Current rig tests use a tmp-$HOME unit sandbox; this is the full clean-room integration.)
- **Slim `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` to PERSONAL-ONLY** (#3704): it should hold only user-specific content
  (identity / "address me as Alex" / preferences / dictionary / Telegram report style). ALL universal
  tool + process docs (how to use `review`/`tg`/`draw`, the no-short-timeout rule, etc.) must
  self-advertise via SKILLS, not be hand-written there — many already have skills + the `<!-- skill:X -->`
  blurbs are the self-advertising mechanism. The hand-written "## Review and sanity checks" section
  duplicates the `review` skill → remove it; audit the rest the same way. (My in-place "migrate CLAUDE.md
  review docs to subcommands" was wrong — those docs shouldn't live in CLAUDE.md at all.) Careful pass,
  it's the global config. (alex-mextner/agent-tools#15)
- **Decisions-as-buttons + the hanging-question DANGER** (#3706): verify the agent
  question-with-options flow (tg inline tappable buttons) actually works end-to-end. **Critical
  bug risk:** `tg-ctl` injects inbound messages into the agent's tmux pane via `send-keys`; if an
  interactive prompt/question is open in that pane, the injected text is typed INTO the prompt and
  LOST/corrupts it. Fix: answers must come through a SEPARATE channel (tg inline buttons → routed
  reply), and while a question is pending tg-ctl must DEFER/queue inbound text injection (detect the
  pending-question state) rather than blast it into the pane. Test + fix. (alex-mextner/tg-cli#30)
- **tg-cli `tg#<id>` message-ref convention** (tg#3715): reference inbound TG messages as `tg#3715`
  (NOT bare `#3715` — collides with PR/issue refs). The inbound inject wrap should render the id as
  `tg#<id>`; the autolink layer must recognize `tg#\d+` as a message reference and link it, **before**
  the PR/issue `#\d+` detection runs. ("— reply via tg" suffix already removed, tg-cli main 83ac5db.)
  (alex-mextner/tg-cli#28)
- **tg-cli file-excerpt attachment** (tg#3715): when a message gives a file **path + line / line-range**
  (in any of the common formats — `path:42`, `path:10-20`, `path#L10-L20`, etc.), attach the actual
  excerpt (the referenced lines) as a quote below. Currently broken — fix. (alex-mextner/tg-cli#29)
- **tg-cli `/new` command** (tg#3717): `/new [<model>] [<dir>] name [<task description>]` — spawn a new
  agent session. **Omitted options are chosen interactively via inline buttons.** Directory options =
  the dirs already in use + their `..` parents, all normalized + uniq + ranked LRU/MRU. `name` validated
  with a **uniqueness warning**. (Pairs with the decisions-as-buttons work.) (alex-mextner/tg-cli#27)
- **tg-ctl must self-register for system autostart on first run** (CTO 2026-06-16): on first launch the
  tg-ctl daemon installs a boot/login autostart entry so it survives reboots — per-OS, for every OS
  agent-tools supports: macOS → launchd LaunchAgent (same mechanism as continuum's `Tmux.Start.plist`);
  Ubuntu/Debian/other Linux → systemd **user** service (`systemctl --user enable`), with a fallback for
  no-systemd. Idempotent (re-run safe), removable, and the supported-OS matrix lives in agent-tools.
  Pairs with the task-cli/tg-ctl daemon-supervisor work (§3 daemon-supervisor).
- **review brainstorm must FAIL LOUD when backends return empty (not silently "converge")** (CTO
  2026-06-16): observed a brainstorm that ran 5 rounds with every round empty ("(no output)") and the
  moderator stamping `DECISION: STOP` each time → it printed an empty synthesis and exited as if it
  worked, wasting ~20 min of "it's still thinking". When all/most panel seats return empty for a round,
  the run must surface a clear error (dead/credential-less backends) and non-zero exit, not a hollow
  STOP. Pairs with the dead-provider cleanup (Fireworks suspended) — and with the new `review sessions`
  resume work (a dead run should be resumable AND diagnosable).
- **tg-cli rejects messages containing URLs / `--` / colons with a bogus "Only those HTML tags are
  supported" error** (CTO 2026-06-16): a plain-text message (no `<`/`>`/`&`) that merely contains a
  `https://…` link or `--flag` or `1: foo` fails to send; stripping the URL/double-dash made the SAME
  text send fine (`OK`). So tg is defaulting to an HTML/markdown parse_mode and mis-parsing ordinary
  punctuation as entities. Fix: auto-escape (or send `parse_mode=None` by default and only opt into
  HTML via `--format html`), so links and CLI snippets in reports just work. Cost us 4 failed sends.
  PINPOINTED: the trigger is the `://` scheme — `https://github.com/...` fails, bare `github.com/...`
  sends `OK` (telegram autolinks the domain). Even a correct `<a href="https://…">` tag is rejected by
  tg's OWN pre-send validation (before telegram sees it), confirming it's tg-cli mis-parsing, not the
  Bot API. Workaround in use: send links as bare domains (no scheme).
- tg-cli #25: fix-or-justify the 8 CodeQL TS findings (length-counting helpers + install TOCTOU).
  (alex-mextner/tg-cli#31)
- tg-cli AGENTS stale "~578 tests" → 997. (alex-mextner/tg-cli#32)
- hyper-saas AGENTS.md "further-trim candidates" (Systematic Debugging / Dead-code / On-Task-Completion
  / Naming / Codex-Specific) — CTO to confirm before trimming (generic blocks now covered by skills).
  (No tracking issue — hyper-saas is a product repo, not a tool repo, and this is CTO-gated.)
- Billing: Fireworks/Fire Pass (`glide` account) suspended — only that provider is down; rest work.
  (No issue — account-status note; the dead-provider dependency is removed by alex-mextner/review-cli#25.)
- **`review --mcp` is broken ecosystem-wide** (no tracking issue yet — surfaced by the auto-mode rollout
  reviewers): the review subcommand refactor dropped the `--mcp` flag, but `~/.claude/mcp/mcp.json` AND
  every rig.yaml `mcp.review.command` still invoke `review --mcp` → `rig apply` registers a dead MCP
  server (and the global review MCP is currently inert). Fix-or-remove: implement a real review MCP
  entrypoint, or drop `mcp.review` from the rig.yaml template + the global registration. Affects all
  six provisioned tool repos' rig.yaml.

### 10. Third-party skill/tool ecosystem: enable · harmonize · delineate (RESEARCH) (tg#3754)

**Problem (CTO observation):** parse a month of hyper sessions and **most installed third-party skills/tools
were never invoked.** Same root cause as the skill-loading + hook-firing gaps — *installed ≠ discovered ≠
applied.* We've accreted overlapping tool systems with no routing doctrine → agents default to grep/Read and
ignore the specialized tools, or burn tokens choosing between redundant ones. Need a data-driven triage:
which to enable, which to harmonize, which to delineate, which to prune.

**Full inventory of third-party / external systems to triage (NOT our own ecosystem):**

- **MCP servers (tool providers):**
  - **Haft** (`h-reason`) — structured engineering reasoning, decision artifacts, FPF patterns. Heavy ceremony.
    Overlaps superpowers brainstorming + the `h-reason` skill dir.
  - **superpowers** — skill-discovery framework + workflow skills (using-superpowers, brainstorming, debugging,
    TDD…). Self-asserts at SessionStart.
  - **sverklo** — multi-repo code intelligence: semantic search, concepts/clusters, memories, impact/deps,
    review-diff. Overlaps serena + grep + the `semantic-code-search` skill.
  - **serena** — LSP-backed semantic code: symbol find/edit, references, onboarding, project memories.
    Overlaps sverklo + grep.
  - **context7** — live library/framework docs. Overlaps WebFetch + agent-browser.
  - **computer-use** — desktop control (native apps, cross-app).
  - **claude-in-chrome** — browser automation (DOM-aware). Overlaps computer-use browser tier + agent-browser.
- **CLI-backed external skills:** **agent-browser** — read web pages as markdown (replaces WebFetch for long
  pages). Overlaps context7 + WebFetch + claude-in-chrome.
- **Hand-authored skill dirs (non-rule):** **h-reason**, **debate-swarm**, **moshi-best-practices**.
- *(Boundary, NOT the subject: our own — tg, review, draw, 3d, rig, task-cli, rtk, linear, + 50 agent-tools
  rule-skills. The research delineates the third-party tools AGAINST these.)*

**Three axes:**

1. **Enable (заэнейблить)** — audit each: actually installed + discoverable in EVERY harness we support?
   (Likely many are configured-but-inert or cc-only — same failure class as skill-loading/hook-firing.)
2. **Harmonize (подружить)** — make overlapping systems compose, not collide: Haft-vs-superpowers reasoning;
   serena-vs-sverklo memories (two stores + agent-tools MEMORY.md = THREE memory systems); two
   "think-before-build" frameworks; agent-browser-vs-context7-vs-WebFetch doc reading.
3. **Delineate (разграничить)** — a written routing doctrine / decision table so an agent picks right without
   burning tokens: code search → serena (symbol-precise) | sverklo (cross-repo concept) | grep (literal);
   docs → context7 (libraries) | agent-browser (arbitrary web); reasoning → Haft (irreversible/decision-record)
   | superpowers brainstorming (divergence).

**Evidence step (the killer):** parse ~1 month of hyper session transcripts (`~/.claude/projects/**/**.jsonl`),
count tool/skill invocations by name, surface the never-fired and rarely-fired. Output = a routing-doctrine doc

- concrete enable/prune/route actions (likely a rig provisioning concern + a routing skill).
Tracking issue: **alex-mextner/agent-tools#19**.

**✅ Evidence DONE (2026-06-15) — hypothesis confirmed:** only **9/204 hyper sessions (4.4%)** invoked any
third-party tool; serena + claude-in-chrome = literal zero. Root cause: those tools are **deferred** (need a
ToolSearch first) so the agent stays on the zero-friction Bash+grep path. Full table + script in **#19**.

## Key constraints / lessons (read before continuing)

- **Python-only ecosystem; tg migrates last; lib is plain Python.** (Decided twice — don't re-ask.)
- **Every provider/harness write-up should be GENERAL, not special-cased** (no "opencode does X" when
  every harness does X). Models marked by **capabilities**, not just version.
- **auto-mode `bypassPermissions` = COMMITTED `.claude/settings.json`** (CC's shared slot → turns on by
  itself; `.claude/settings.local.json` is the gitignored personal slot). [Reversed 2026-06-15.] Its
  "safe because guards fire" rationale is **RESOLVED 2026-06-16** (#18/#20 bridge merged + wired into
  `~/.claude/settings.json` + live-proven; guards fire under auto-mode). No longer bridge-pending.
- **Use `gh ship`, not raw `gh pr merge`** (the `block-raw-pr-merge` guard enforces it — now LIVE via the bridge).
- Tool repos work directly on `main` (push often); hyper-saas via PR + `gh ship`.
- This roadmap lives in `agent-tools` because ecosystem work should run from a tool repo / agent-tools,
  not from an unrelated product repo.

## 🆕 From the GHAS-parity analysis (2026-06-15, tg#3777/#3779/#3780)

We dropped every GHAS / licensed-action gate for free OSS equivalents (gitleaks OSS **binary** instead of the
licensed `gitleaks-action`; scripted `dep-audit.sh` instead of `dependency-review-action`). Verified parity:
secret-scan is **identical** (same engine + `useDefault` ruleset), dep-audit is **equal-or-better** for vulns
(whole-tree vs PR-diff). Two follow-ups the parity check surfaced:

- **OSS license-policy gate — agent-tools #21.** The one real gap: `dependency-review-action` also enforced a
  license allow/deny policy, which `dep-audit.sh` does not. Fill with an OSS license checker
  (`license-checker` / `cargo-deny` / `pip-licenses`), rig-provisioned as a CI gate, default-deny copyleft
  (AGPL/GPL) to match the old template. Lives in `ci/license-policy/`.
- **Self-hosted security findings dashboard — agent-tools #22.** The one thing GHAS uniquely offered that we
  don't replicate is its hosted code-scanning dashboard. Aggregate the OSS scanners' SARIF/JSON (CodeQL-CLI,
  Semgrep, gitleaks, dep-audit) into one Tailscale-served dashboard — likely **extending review-cli's existing
  dashboard** (SARIF is the common format). CTO: copy GitHub's code-scanning UI and improve it (cross-repo
  view, our own triage state, link to the suppressing `// codeql[...]` line).

## ⚠️ rig tmux v2 — REAL reboot cycle broke (CTO 2026-06-16, post-reboot)

The #24/#26 tmux provisioning passed unit (456) + tmux parse-check but I never ran a REAL
e2e (apply→save→REBOOT→restore) on a live machine. A reboot exposed multiple defects — fix
so a CLEAN-machine `rig init` does EVERYTHING with NO manual steps:

1. **boot**: launchd ran `tmux start-server` = an EMPTY server (config/plugins load only on the
   first session, so continuum-restore never fired). Use a boot script that `tmux new-session -d`
   (loads conf) THEN restores; and `rig` must `launchctl load` the agent itself (it didn't).
2. **cc-save detect**: filtered on `pane_current_command == claude`, but cc shows as its VERSION
   (`2.1.178`); the real process is a CHILD (`claude --resume`, pid in the pane's tree). Detect via
   the pane's process tree, not the command string → map was empty → cc never resumed.
3. **default-command `''`** → resurrect restores a NON-login shell → `.zprofile` not sourced.
   Set a login shell so restored panes get the full env.
4. **resurrect dir** `~/.tmux/resurrect` was absent → no snapshot written at all. Ensure it exists.
5. **old continuum boot not cleaned**: `osx_iterm/terminal_start_tmux.sh` still register in macOS
   Login Items (competing boot). rig must disable/clean them (continuum `osx_disable.sh` + unload).
6. **plugins/tpm install + first save**: on a clean machine rig must install tpm + resurrect/
   continuum (clone) and take a first resurrect save, else there is nothing to restore.
**Acceptance = a REAL e2e**, not unit-only: fresh HOME → `rig init` → boot brings tmux up with the
restored session, cc resumes by session-id, panes are login shells. Verify on THIS machine too.

## ⚠️ rig MUST gate smoke.sh on pre-commit + always run smoke, not just pytest (CTO 2026-06-16)

Two failures the same day traced to the SAME root: I shipped rig changes after green PYTEST
(456/460) but NEVER ran `bash tests/smoke.sh` — the real `rig init/apply/status` flow.

- `rig status` errored `unknown mcp item(s): review (known: none)` — a STALE `mcp.items.review`
  (the `review --mcp` slot was removed in #32) lingered in `~/.config/rig/config.yaml`. smoke
  (which runs `rig status` against a sample config) would have caught it. (FIXED on this machine
  by removing the block; the rig-cli template is already clean — verify `rig init` never re-adds it.)
- the tmux reboot-cycle defects (see "rig tmux v2") — unit-only, no real e2e.
REQUIREMENTS:

1. **rig provisions a pre-commit hook (via its own git-hooks dispatcher / lefthook) that runs
   `bash tests/smoke.sh`** for the rig-cli repo (and offers it to any repo that has a smoke target),
   so a commit that breaks the real CLI flow is blocked locally — not just in CI.
2. **Every rig PR runs smoke (real flow), not just pytest.** smoke must exercise `rig status` with a
   config that includes EVERY catalog area (skills/hooks/CI/mcp/tmux) so an unknown-item / dead-slot
   regression fails loudly. Add an assertion that `rig status` exits 0 on the sample config.
3. CI already runs smoke (`tests/smoke.sh`) — keep it; the gap was LOCAL pre-commit + my discipline.

## ⚠️ rig (+ ecosystem) error system v2 — every error says what/why/how-to-fix, with heuristics (CTO 2026-06-16)

Today's failures were hard to diagnose because the errors were thin: `unknown mcp item(s): review
(known: none)` (no hint it was a removed slot or how to remove it); a dead rtk hook surfaced only as
a generic CC "PreToolUse error"; tmux defects were SILENT (no error at all). Build a real error layer:

- **Every rig error = 3 parts**: WHAT happened, WHY (root cause / context), HOW to fix (a concrete
  command or edit). Pattern from the `structured-exit-codes` skill. Stable, per-class EXIT CODES.
- **Heuristics**:
  - *did-you-mean*: for an unknown item (mcp/skill/hook/ci/tmux key) Levenshtein-match against the
    catalog and suggest the nearest valid name, OR say "no such slot" + list the known ones.
  - *deprecated/removed slots*: a registry of removed slots (e.g. `mcp.items.review` removed in #32,
    `review --ln`/`--mcp` dropped) → the error names the PR and says "remove it from <config path>"
    (and, when `rig config unset` exists, prints that exact command).
  - *missing-target*: a config points at a file/binary that doesn't exist (the rtk-hook case:
    settings.json → a hook path that's gone) → say which file is missing and how to regenerate it.
  - *silent-success guard*: an apply/provision that did nothing meaningful (empty cc-map, no snapshot,
    hook installed but inert) must WARN, not look clean — tie into `rig status`/`doctor`.
- **`rig doctor` / `rig status` surface these proactively** (drift + dead-config + missing-target), so
  a problem is visible BEFORE it bites at runtime/reboot.
- Generalize the pattern so review/tg/draw/3d/task CLIs reuse it (shared lib `errors` module candidate,
  §3). Tests assert the message contains the fix hint + the right exit code per failure class.
Build as a background subagent; do NOT merge without the CTO's verify (real `rig status`/smoke proof).

## rig status — separate GLOBAL vs REPO layers + clearer drift (CTO 2026-06-16, part of error-system v2)

`rig status` in a repo (e.g. hyperide) mixes machine-wide GLOBAL drift (skills in ~/.agents, harness
links, agent-hooks — owned by `~/.config/rig/config.yaml`) with REPO drift (this repo's `.github/`
CI, AGENTS/CLAUDE symlinks, rig.yaml). Group the output by LAYER:

- **GLOBAL** (from ~/.config/rig/config.yaml): skills/hooks/harness/mcp on this machine.
- **REPO** (from ./rig.yaml): CI workflows, repo symlinks, repo settings.
Each item should show WHICH layer/config FILE declares it (or "not declared in any layer").
Also make the "extras are left for you to decide" guarantee LOUD (apply NEVER deletes disk-not-declared
items) so a user isn't scared `rig apply` will nuke their skills — print that reassurance in `status`
and in `rig apply --help`. And: a repo with NO committed rig.yaml should say so prominently with the
fix (`run rig init to create one`), not just a one-line warning buried above a 49-line drift dump.
Ties into the did-you-mean / 3-part-error work.

## rig status: non-git dir must NOT claim "no rig.yaml, should be committed" (CTO 2026-06-16)

`rig status` run in `~` (no `.git/`) prints "warning: no rig.yaml in this repo (it should be committed)"
— but `~` is NOT a repo at all. Detect non-git dirs: show ONLY the global layer + "(not a git
repository — repo layer/rig.yaml N/A here)". The "commit a rig.yaml" advice only applies inside an
actual git repo. Part of the error-system/status-clarity work.

## review-cli must not crash outside a git repo (CTO 2026-06-16)

Running bare `review` outside a `.git` repo throws a raw RuntimeError + Python traceback
(`_git_diff` → `git diff` failed) — a user just trying the tool gets a stack trace. Fix:

- git is needed ONLY by the diff modes (`review`/`review review`, `--diff`, `--staged`).
  `just-ask`, `quorum`, `brainstorm` do NOT need git and must work anywhere.
- Outside a git repo, the diff path must fail GRACEFULLY (no traceback): a clear 3-part message —
  "not in a git repository; the diff review needs one. Run `review just-ask`/`quorum`/`brainstorm`
  (no git needed), or cd into a repo" — and a stable non-zero exit code (align with the rig
  error-system / `structured-exit-codes` work).
- Bare `review --list-defaults` / `--show-board` / `--help` (meta) must work outside a repo too.
- Add a smoke/test: run `review` and `review just-ask "x"` in a non-git tmpdir; assert no traceback,
  helpful message + correct exit on the diff path, and just-ask/meta paths work.
Fix as a background subagent (review-cli), no merge without CTO verify.

## review-cli: rename `review review` → `review diff`; bare `review` = HELP (CTO 2026-06-16)

`review review …` is bad UX (stutter). Two changes:

- The diff-review SUBCOMMAND is renamed `review` → **`review diff`**. (The "review review" stutter and
  the "bare review defaults to a diff review" behavior were a mistake — never do that.)
- **Bare `review` (no subcommand/args) prints the HELP/usage**, it does NOT silently run a diff review
  (today it dumps "No diff to review" or, outside git, crashes). Meta flags still work
  (`review --list-defaults` etc.).
- Other subcommands unchanged: `diff`, `brainstorm`, `just-ask`, `quorum`, `dashboard`, `spec-web`, …
- Update README/AGENTS, the `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` review-skill blurb, and any docs that say
  `review review`. Decide migration: a removed-`review`-subcommand should print a one-line
  "use `review diff`" pointer (like the old removed mode-flags), not error opaquely.
SEQUENCING: do this in review-cli AFTER the "non-git graceful" PR merges (same cli.py/dispatch area) —
one review-cli agent at a time to avoid collisions. CTO verifies, no blind merge.

## install-* commands must show INSTALLED state (✓ + "already configured") (CTO 2026-06-16)

The `install-skill` / `install-commit-hook` / `register-module` (review-cli) and rig's `install-*`
surfaces should INDICATE current state, not just offer the action. When the thing is already set up,
show a green ✓ + "already configured — nothing to do" (idempotent, like `rig doctor`'s dependency
checks). So a user listing/running install-* sees what's done vs pending at a glance. Applies to
review-cli install subcommands and any rig install/provision listing (status/doctor style). Part of
the ecosystem error-system / clarity work — implement alongside it (subagents), CTO verifies.

## Topic-based help across the ecosystem (CTO 2026-06-16)

Tools need DEEP help topics, advertised from the main help:

- **review**: `review help config` (or `review --help config`) — a real config reference: the reviewer
  board, model/backend selection, config file paths + cascade (`~/.config/review-cli/…` + repo), env
  vars, how to add/override a seat. The MAIN `review --help` must POINT at it ("see `review help config`
  for configuration", plus any other topics).
- **Generalize**: a `<tool> help <topic>` convention for non-obvious features (config, board/models,
  auth, output formats, etc.), and the top-level `--help` LISTS the available topics. Apply across the
  ecosystem — review, tg, draw, 3d, rig, task — each ships the topic helps relevant to it.
- Keep topic help in sync with behavior (the `help-docs-sync` skill): a flag/behavior change updates its
  topic help in the same commit. Tests assert main `--help` lists the topics and each topic prints.
Implement via subagents (per tool), CTO verifies. Start with `review help config` since that's the ask.

## Help must show ACTUAL defaults — esp. --model (CTO 2026-06-16)

In `review --help` (and across tools) every configurable option must show its EFFECTIVE default value,
not a vague description:

- **`--model`**: today it says only "model/backend to run; repeat or comma-separate" — it must show the
  ACTUAL default (the reviewer board / models that run when you DON'T pass --model). E.g. "(default: the
  active board — see `review help config` / `--show-board`)" or the concrete default model id(s).
- Other configurable defaults (`--pool` 4, `--timeout` 1200/240, `--moderator`, `--vision-timeout`, …)
  already show some defaults — make ALL of them show their CURRENT effective value, respecting the config
  cascade (if the user set a default in config, the help reflects it, or at least points at where it's set).
- Generalize to the ecosystem: a flag with a configurable default prints that default in --help. Ties into
  topic-help (`review help config`) and the help-docs-sync skill (tests assert --help shows defaults).
Implement with the review-cli UX subagent (queued after non-git), CTO verifies.

## Subcommand-only options belong in the subcommand help, not the global list (CTO 2026-06-16)

`review --help` dumps options that apply only to specific modes/features into the GLOBAL option list,
cluttering it. Scope them:

- **Visual-only opts** (`--visual` and its companions `--before`, `--intent`, `--expect`, `--check`,
  `--json`, `--strict`, `--no-ai`, `--no-local-model`, `--vision-timeout`, `--project`) belong in the
  visual section / `review --visual --help`, NOT the global list.
- Mode-only opts belong on that subcommand's parser (`review brainstorm --help` already owns
  `--rounds`/`--max-rounds` — do the same for every mode/feature-specific flag).
- The GLOBAL `review --help` shows only TRULY global opts (`-m/--model`, `-C`, `-o`, `--timeout`,
  `--list-defaults`, `--show-board`, `--pool`) + the subcommands list + the topic-help pointer.
- argparse: give each subcommand (and the composable `--visual` feature) its own argument group/parser so
  `--help` is scoped automatically. Tests assert a visual-only flag does NOT appear in the global help and
  DOES appear in the visual/subcommand help.
Part of the review-cli UX subagent (queued after non-git). Generalize the principle to other tools' CLIs.

## review dashboard as a managed service (run/start/status/stop/enable/disable) (CTO 2026-06-16)

`review dashboard` gets service-style subcommands:

- **run** — run in the foreground (this shell), blocking; for `disable`d / ad-hoc use.
- **start** — start in the BACKGROUND (detached daemon), return immediately.
- **status** — is it running? pid/port/url.
- **stop** — stop the background instance.
- **enable** — install OS autostart (launchd LaunchAgent on macOS / systemd user unit on Linux — same
  mechanism as the tg-ctl autostart item) AND start it in the background now.
- **disable** — remove autostart (and stop).
- **bare `review dashboard`** (no subcommand) → print the dashboard HELP (like bare `review` → help),
  not launch anything.
- On `start`/`run`, HINT how to enable autostart ("run `review dashboard enable` to start at login").
Idempotent, removable; supported-OS matrix in agent-tools. SHARE the run/start/status/stop/enable/disable

- OS-autostart machinery with tg-ctl autostart and the daemon-supervisor (§3) — one service-management
helper, not per-tool copies. review-cli UX subagent (queued), CTO verifies.

## review-cli dashboard is under-tested — fix data + tabs, real visual QA (CTO 2026-06-16)

A live look at `review dashboard` shows it was never properly tested:

- **literal "topic"** is rendered for every brainstorm session instead of the REAL brainstorm topic
  (a placeholder/parse bug — pull the actual topic from the discussion-log header `# Brainstorm: <topic>`).
- **missing data everywhere**: panel sessions show no prompt/title; many fields blank.
- **tabs barely work**: Overview/Chat logs/Stats/Models&roles/Metrics/Overseer feedback/Modes/Errors/
  Tasks/Prompts/PRs&tickets — several likely empty/broken ("mostly doesn't work").
Fix: populate REAL data per session (brainstorm topic, panel prompt, models, durations, error details);
every tab either renders real data or is removed; wire the parser to the actual log/store format.
ACCEPTANCE = real visual QA (the `visual-proof-cycle` skill): start the dashboard against sample logs,
SCREENSHOT each tab, READ IT BACK, assert no "topic" placeholder and real data shows — not unit-only.
This is the same failure mode as the tmux/smoke gaps today: looked done, wasn't exercised. review-cli
subagent, CTO verifies with a screenshot.

## ONE shared help-formatter in agent-tools/lib — reuse across ALL tools (CTO 2026-06-16)

tg-cli's `--help` is NOT colorized like review/rig/draw — inconsistent. ROOT PRINCIPLE (CTO, repeated):
extract EVERYTHING reusable into `agent-tools/lib` and share it; do not re-implement per tool. Help is a
prime candidate — build ONE shared help layer (Python lib module, §3) and have every CLI use it:

- colors/styling, section layout, usage line, subcommands list;
- the help-clarity rules from today all live HERE so a fix lands everywhere: show ACTUAL defaults
  (esp. --model), SCOPE subcommand-only options to their subcommand, topic-help (`<tool> help <topic>`)
  advertised in main help, install-* state (✓ already-configured), service subcommands help.
- the 3-part error/exit-code layer (error-system v2) is the same story — one shared `errors` + `help`
  module, consumed by review/rig/tg/draw/3d/task.
tg-cli is Bun/TS (migrates to Python LAST) — until then, at minimum match the color scheme; after
migration it imports the shared lib like the rest. Tracking: agent-tools#12 (shared lib). Build the
shared help/errors modules, then refit each CLI (subagents), CTO verifies parity (same look across tools).

## tg --tag: lowercase-english only (CTO 2026-06-16)

`tg --tag` currently accepts Russian (ОТВЕТ/РЕШЕНИЕ/...) and uppercase. Restrict to LOWERCASE ENGLISH
words only: `answer` / `decision` / `problem` / `report` (and any other defined tags) — lowercase. Reject
anything else with a clear 3-part error ("tag must be a lowercase english word, e.g. answer/decision/
problem/report"). Update tg docs + the ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md tg blurb (it currently shows ОТВЕТ/РЕШЕНИЕ).
tg-cli is Bun/TS (no local checkout — clone first); pairs with tg help-coloring (match other tools) and the
shared help/errors lib (after the Python migration). Subagent, CTO verifies.

## tg help specifics (CTO 2026-06-16) — apply with the tg-cli help work

- **Don't repeat `[--format text|html]` many times** in the help. It's a global option — show it ONCE
  (in the global options), not duplicated per command/usage line.
- **Replace the `--format-help` flag with standard topic-help**: `tg help format` (and `tg help <topic>`
  for other such sections). The MAIN `tg --help` briefly LISTS the available topics ("see `tg help format`
  …"). Same convention as the ecosystem topic-help item — not a bespoke `--format-help` flag.
- **`tg voice setup` (and similar setup/install surfaces) show actual STATUS**: green ✓ when configured,
  yellow ○ when not — the install-* state principle, applied to voice setup. So the user sees what's done
  vs pending without running it blindly.
These extend the already-queued tg-cli help work (--tag + coloring + shared help lib). CTO verifies.

## rig status must cover ALL reconciled areas, not mostly skills (CTO 2026-06-16)

`rig status` is skill-heavy, but rig reconciles MANY areas — all must show, grouped by area (and by the
GLOBAL vs REPO layer split): skills, agent-hooks (v1 descriptors), git-hooks dispatcher, CI gates,
MCP servers, AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md symlinks, repo settings (branch protection / GHAS / merge policy),
harness auto-mode settings, tmux config (the new provisioning), model-freshness cron, ship/`gh ship`.
Each AREA shows in-sync vs drift (count) under its heading, so the user sees the FULL picture of what rig
manages and where it's out of sync — not a wall of skill lines with everything else buried. Ties into the
error-system/status-clarity agent (global/repo separation + which config file declares each).

## Commands should work OUTSIDE a repo; task list groups by repo/project (CTO 2026-06-16)

General principle (same spirit as review-non-git): a tool's read/list/global operations should NOT require
being inside a git repo. Specifically:

- **`task list` outside any repo** → show ALL tasks across repos/projects, GROUPED by repo/project (a
  heading per project, tasks under it). Inside a repo → scope to that repo (current) but offer `--all` for
  the cross-repo grouped view.
- Other task-cli read commands (status/show) work outside a repo too; only repo-bound actions (create-in-
  this-repo) need a repo, and then with a clear message if absent.
- Generalize: every ecosystem CLI's non-repo-bound commands run anywhere; only diff/repo-scoped ops need a
  repo, failing gracefully (3-part error) when missing. Pairs with review-non-git + rig-status-non-git.
task-cli is in-flight (foundation agent a9cef4ca) — fold this into it. CTO verifies.

## task list: fallback to all-tasks + pagination + session-vs-all messaging (CTO 2026-06-16)

`task list` defaults to THIS-agent-SESSION's tasks. But:

- In a repo, run OUTSIDE an agent session → FALL BACK to showing ALL tasks (grouped by repo/project).
- In a session but NO session tasks → same fallback (show all tasks).
- In BOTH fallback cases, the output must SAY SO: "showing all project tasks (`task list` defaults to
  tasks created in the agent session)" — so the user understands why they see everything.
- **Pagination**: default through a pager (less, like git), with `NO_PAGER`/`--no-pager` support and the
  git convention (no pager when output fits / not a tty). Respect `$PAGER`.
Fold into task-cli (foundation agent a9cef4ca). Pairs with "commands work outside repo / group by project".

## task list pager: interactive-only + higher limit there (CTO 2026-06-16)

Refinement of the task-list pagination: the PAGER (less) is used ONLY in interactive mode (stdout is a
tty). In non-interactive (piped/scripted) output → NO pager, plain text (scriptable). In interactive
mode the display LIMIT is HIGHER (e.g. 100 tasks) since the pager handles scrolling; non-interactive
keeps a small default (or `--all`/all, machine-readable). Respect `NO_PAGER`/`--no-pager`/`$PAGER` and the
git convention. Fold into the task-cli list work.

## Universal zsh tab-completion: shared generator + auto-installer in agent-tools/lib (CTO 2026-06-16)

ONE shared module in `agent-tools/lib` that GENERATES and AUTO-INSTALLS zsh tab-completion for every tool
(review, rig, tg, draw, 3d, task) — not per-tool copies (the "extract everything reusable" principle).

- **Generator**: derive completions from each tool's CLI structure — subcommands, options, topic-help
  topics, choice values (argparse introspection for the Python tools). Keeps completion in sync with the
  CLI automatically (no hand-written, drift-prone _tool files).
- **Auto-installer**: on first run (idempotent) and/or `<tool> completion install` — write the completion
  into an fpath dir (e.g. ~/.zsh/completions) + ensure it's on `fpath` + `compinit`, with clear status
  (✓ installed / how to enable). Removable (`completion uninstall`). No clobber, idempotent.
- Bash later if needed, but zsh first. Ties into the shared help/errors lib (one lib stack, §3).
Build as a subagent on agent-tools/lib + wire each tool, CTO verifies (tab-complete actually works in zsh).

## task-cli classifier (change vs justAsk) — make it accurate, fast, reliable (CTO 2026-06-16)

`task classify 'когда началась сессия?'` → `change` — WRONG (it's a justAsk question). The change/justAsk
classifier is inaccurate. Improve it properly:

- **Brainstorm a fast + reliable design** (done as a real review brainstorm — see launch). Likely: cheap
  deterministic heuristics first (interrogative words/`?` → justAsk; imperative verbs/file refs → change)
  to short-circuit obvious cases with ZERO LLM latency, then a small local-model head (haiku) with a
  provider fallback chain only for the ambiguous middle; cache by normalized text.
- **Metrics + benchmarks + tests**: a LABELED dataset (change vs justAsk, RU+EN, incl. tricky cases like
  "когда началась сессия?"). Report accuracy / precision / recall per class + p50/p95 latency. CI test
  asserts accuracy ≥ threshold and latency budget. Track regressions.
- **Deliberate small BIAS toward `change`**: a false-`change` is cheaper than a false-`justAsk` (better to
  over-propose a task than to silently drop a real change). Tune the threshold accordingly + document it.
- **The task-FORMING agent must be told the classification MAY BE A FALSE POSITIVE**: when it turns a
  `change` into a ticket, instruct it to sanity-check ("this was auto-classified as a change and may be
  wrong — if it's actually a question, don't create a ticket") so the bias doesn't create noise.
task-cli (foundation agent a9cef4ca). CTO verifies with the benchmark numbers.

## task list --all shows nothing on hyperide (CTO 2026-06-16)

`task list --all` returns NOTHING in the hyperide repo — it should show ALL tasks across all known
projects/repos (grouped by project, per the outside-repo/grouping item). Bug in the `--all` cross-repo
aggregation (backend query scope, or it only looks at the current repo). Fix + test: `--all` returns tasks
from every configured/known project (GitHub Issues + Linear backends), grouped, with the session-vs-all
messaging. Pairs with the task-list grouping/fallback items. task-cli.

## First-run mapping for external per-repo config → persist to rig.yaml; informative/proactive/friendly (CTO 2026-06-16)

PILLARS of our tooling: informative, proactive, friendly. The `linear` CLI fails cryptically when it can't
infer the team key from the dir name ("Could not determine team key from directory name or team flag") —
the user must manually `linear team list` then `--team HYP`. Our tooling (task-cli with the Linear backend,
and any tool wrapping an external command that needs per-repo config) must instead:

- **First-run mapping flow**: when a needed per-repo value (Linear team key, project, etc.) is missing,
  DETECT it (e.g. fetch `linear team list`; if exactly one team → auto-pick) or ASK, then PERSIST it to the
  LOCAL `rig.yaml` (repo config) so it's remembered — no re-asking, no cryptic failures next time.
- **Interactive mode**: show the options (the team list) and let the user pick; confirm what was written.
- **Non-interactive mode**: auto-infer when unambiguous (single team), else take a flag/env, else fail with
  a clear 3-part error (WHAT/WHY/HOW: "run `<tool> link --team HYP`" or "set X in rig.yaml").
- **Informative/proactive/friendly**: tell the user what was detected, what got written to rig.yaml, and
  how to change it — never a bare "could not determine X".
Generalize across the ecosystem; tie into rig.yaml repo config + the error-system. task-cli/rig subagents.

## task list: interactive TUI + non-interactive hints (CTO 2026-06-16)

- **Interactive mode (tty)**: `task list` is a TUI — a SCROLLABLE list, tasks are SELECTABLE (arrow keys
  - enter to open/act), and tasks CREATED IN THIS SESSION are visually MARKED/highlighted. Take inspiration
  from the linear CLI's TUI (key/state columns, navigation). Pairs with the interactive pager + higher limit.
- **Non-interactive mode (piped/script)**: no TUI — plain list, and print a DIMMED/grey HINT showing how to
  open a task or do basic ops (e.g. "↳ `task show <id>` to view · `task done <id>` to close"). Informative,
  proactive, friendly (the pillars) without breaking machine-readability (hint on stderr or clearly dimmed).
Folds into the task-cli list work (grouping, --all, session-vs-all messaging, pager). task-cli.

## task current: map a CURRENT task to the session/dir (CTO 2026-06-16)

A CURRENT task can be mapped to the agent session / working directory:

- **`task current get|set|unlink|change|link`** — manage the mapping. `get` shows the current task;
  `link`/`set` binds a task as current; `change` swaps it; `unlink` clears it. (Use consistent verbs;
  `link`+`change`+`unlink`, with `get` to read.)
- The current task is HIGHLIGHTED in `task list` (distinct from the session-created marking) and SURFACED
  prominently (e.g. a header line "current: HYP-xxx …" / shown on a bare `task current`).
- Persisted per session/dir (alongside the team-key / rig.yaml mapping or session state). Informative when
  set/changed (what it points at now). Pairs with the TUI selection + session-task marking + grouping.
task-cli.

## review CLI must be RESILIENT to backend 500 / rate-limit (CTO 2026-06-16)

Today review brainstorm/panel returned SILENT-EMPTY (0 bytes) when Anthropic backends threw 500 /
"Server temporarily limiting requests" / model-unavailable. review must HANDLE this, not give up:

- **Retry with exponential backoff + jitter** per backend on transient errors (HTTP 500/502/503/429,
  "rate limited", "temporarily unavailable") — a few attempts before declaring a seat failed.
- **Fall back to other available board seats** (the failover pool already exists for unavailability —
  extend it to transient errors: a 500 on one seat promotes a reserve, not a dead round).
- **NEVER silent-empty**: if a round/all seats fail after retries, FAIL LOUD with a clear error naming
  which backends failed + why + a retry hint + non-zero exit (ties into brainstorm-fail-loud + error-system).
- Make timeouts/retry budgets configurable; surface "retrying seat X (attempt n)" so it's not a silent hang.
review-cli subagent. CTO verifies by simulating backend 500s (mock) — retries fire, fallback works, no
silent-empty.

## review resilience — concrete retry vs reserve-replace policy (CTO 2026-06-16)

Refinement of "review must be resilient": classify backend errors and act per class:

- **Retryable (transient)** — HTTP 500/502/503/429, "rate limited", "temporarily limiting", timeouts:
  RETRY the SAME seat up to ~3 times with exponential backoff + jitter before giving up on it. (3 is the
  default where retrying makes sense; tunable.)
- **Seat-fatal (not worth retrying)** — model unavailable, auth/credential failure, persistent refusal,
  unknown-model: immediately REPLACE that seat with the next RESERVE from the board (failover), don't waste
  retries on a dead seat.
- After retries+replacement exhaust the pool+reserves, FAIL LOUD (which seats failed, why, retry hint,
  non-zero exit) — never silent-empty.
Implement in panel.py/backends.py (the run_panel/failover path) — surface "retry seat X (n/3)" / "seat X
fatal → promoting reserve Y". Tests: mock 500 → 3 retries then success; mock auth-fail → immediate reserve
swap; mock all-fail → loud error + exit code. CTO verifies with mocked backend errors.

## On a killed/crashed review → RESUME via `review sessions -s`, not from scratch (CTO 2026-06-16)

review-cli already ships resumable sessions (PR #31): `review sessions -a` lists sessions incl. interrupted
ones, `review sessions -s <id>` CONTINUES from where it stopped. USE IT. When a long review/brainstorm is
killed or crashes (Anthropic storm, timeout), the continuation must `review sessions -s <id>` instead of
restarting from round 1 — for the orchestrator AND for any subagent that runs review/brainstorm.

- Process rule: before launching a fresh brainstorm/panel, check `review sessions -a` for an INTERRUPTED
  session of the same topic and resume it.
- Pairs with review-resilience (retry/reserve-replace handles transient errors WITHIN a run; sessions-resume
  recovers a run that was killed entirely). Together: a review never has to start over.
- Caveat: a run that died BEFORE writing its discussion log (the classifier brainstorm hit 0 bytes — backends
  never produced a round) has nothing to resume; that's the resilience layer's job (retry/fallback so a round
  is actually produced + logged), after which resume works.

## review retry count must be CONFIGURABLE (CTO 2026-06-16)

The ~3 retries (and backoff/timeout budgets) must be CONFIGURABLE — via review-cli config file, env var
(e.g. REVIEW_RETRIES), and/or a flag — not hardcoded. Sensible default (3), overridable per env/run.

## (reserve-replace failover already exists — verify it actually fires in the logs; see check below)

## reserve-replace failover IS firing, but the promotion event is NOT durably logged (CTO 2026-06-16, VERIFIED)

Verified via `~/.config/review-cli/run-stats.jsonl`: the failover fires on nearly EVERY review run.

- Steady state: `pool_size:4, ok:4, fail:1`, recorded `models=[fable5,opus,codex,glm]`. The planned
  top-4 by board priority (config.py:181-196) is `[fable5,opus,codex,KIMI]`. Kimi (commandcode) dies at
  runtime (timeouts `EXIT 124` / empty `output_tokens=0` in commandcode-r0 logs) and GLM (first reserve)
  backfills it — that's the `fail:1`. So replacement is the steady state, not the exception.
- Heavy cascade 2026-06-16T20:25:40: `models=[fable5,opus,glm,gemini]`, fail=4 — kimi AND codex failed,
  reserve cascaded down to gemini (priority 8).
- Live (21:00-21:06): claude-r0 logs show `ClaudeFable5 is currently unavailable` with EXIT 0 — a sentinel
  body that `result_is_usable` catches → another real-time promotion.
GAP TO FIX: the promotion line `[review-cli] board: X failed — promoting reserve Y` (panel.py:339) is
written to **stderr only**, never to the per-backend `~/Library/Logs/review-cli/*.log` files. So the
failover is invisible "by the logs" — only inferrable from run-stats + EXIT codes. Fix: also append the
FailoverOutcome (each promotion: failed seat, promoted reserve, round) to a durable run log so a kill/
post-mortem can SEE the replacements, not just the final usable set.

## rig must ignore .claude/worktrees globally via core.excludesfile (CTO 2026-06-17, DECIDED)
The harness (Claude Code / Workflow tool) creates throwaway worktrees under each repo's
`.claude/worktrees/`; they pollute `git status` in every repo and even got accidentally
committed into agent-tools as 160000 gitlinks (commit 6d9b5ac, cleaned up forward by
untracking them). CTO DECISION (chosen over PR #23's per-repo `.gitignore` block): rig
provisions a single rig-managed marker block in the GLOBAL git excludes file
(`core.excludesfile`), so it covers EVERY repo on the machine with zero per-repo commits.
- Target resolution: respect an already-set `core.excludesfile` (this machine: `~/.gitignore`);
  else set it to `~/.config/git/ignore` and write the block there. Clean machine: `rig init`
  does both (set the git config + write block).
- Block: `# >>> rig-managed (do not edit) >>>` … `# <<< … <<<`, default entry `**/.claude/worktrees/`.
- STRICT idempotency required: evidence of a prior non-idempotent appender — `~/.config/git/ignore`
  had ~280 duplicated `**/.claude/settings.local.json` lines (and that file is currently DEAD because
  core.excludesfile points elsewhere). rig's reconcile must never duplicate; collapse the managed
  region only, never touch user lines.
- Immediate relief already applied by hand on this machine: rig-marker block with `**/.claude/worktrees/`
  appended to `~/.gitignore`; all repos now ignore it. Reworked rig feature (branch
  `rig-global-excludesfile`, supersedes #23) makes it durable / clean-machine.
- FOLLOW-UP (tracked): clean the DEAD `~/.config/git/ignore` — it has ~280 duplicated
  `**/.claude/settings.local.json` lines and is not even read by git (core.excludesfile points
  to `~/.gitignore`). Harmless now but a latent landmine if rig ever repoints excludesfile there.
  Awaiting CTO go (offered in chat); collapse the dups, leave one canonical line, touch nothing else.

## CORRECTION: --tag ANSWER/ОТВЕТ is NOT a bug — it requires --reply-to (by design)
My earlier entry here claimed `--tag ANSWER` emits an "invalid HTML pill" and marked it VERIFIED.
That was WRONG — I saw the error text and GUESSED the cause instead of reading the source. The CTO
corrected it: `--tag ANSWER`/`ОТВЕТ` REQUIRES `--reply-to <message_id>` — answering means answering
a SPECIFIC message (tg source line ~122: "ANSWER (ОТВЕТ) tag REQUIRES this"). `tg --tag ANSWER "x"`
without `--reply-to` is correctly rejected; `tg --reply-to <id> --tag ОТВЕТ "x"` works (verified by
threading a real reply to msg 3970). The ONLY arguably-rough edge: the rejection prints the generic
"Only those HTML tags are supported…" message instead of a clear "ANSWER requires --reply-to" — a
minor error-message UX nit, NOT a broken-HTML bug. Lesson: do not assert a root cause you have not
verified in the source.

## rig-cli worktree hygiene incidents (2026-06-17, found while reconciling agent PRs)
Two issues surfaced while the parallel rig-cli agents (PRs #27/#28/#29 + tg-ctl-boot) ran:
1. **Orphaned WIP stash — RECLAIM:** an unrelated `agents_md` symlink-"repair" feature (touches
   `riglib/actions/runner.py` + `riglib/drift.py`) was found uncommitted in a worktree and stashed
   by the excludesfile agent as `stash@{0}: pre-existing-agents-md-repair-and-untracked-WIP`
   (repo-global stash, visible from every rig-cli worktree, NOT lost). This is a real forgotten
   feature — investigate (git log -S) and either finish or land it; do NOT drop it.
2. **Main checkout left on a feature branch:** the live `rig` (`~/.local/bin/rig` →
   `~/xp/rig-cli/bin/rig`, the MAIN checkout) was found on branch `rig-global-excludesfile`, not
   `main` — a parallel agent's isolation worktree contaminated the shared main checkout. Restored to
   `main` (tree was clean, branch safe on origin/PR #29). Watch: agents running with isolation:worktree
   against rig-cli are stepping on the shared checkout / each other (the tmux agent also reported a
   two-agent same-worktree collision). Must verify ~/xp/rig-cli is on `main` BEFORE running ship.sh
   (its post-merge pull targets that checkout).

## tmux session-restore for codex / opencode / commandcode (not just claude) (CTO 2026-06-17, #3972)
cc-save originally filtered `pane_current_command == claude`; tmux-v2 (#28) rewrote it to walk the
pane process TREE for `claude`. EXTEND it so session restore works the SAME for the other agent CLIs:
`codex`, `opencode`, `cmd` (commandcode). Per agent kind: detect its process in the pane tree, capture
the cwd + its resumable session id, and on restore relaunch with that agent's resume syntax (claude
`--resume <id>`; codex / opencode / commandcode each have their own — research each CLI's resume flag).
Generalize cc-save/cc-restore from claude-only to a per-agent-kind map. Builds on #28 (the tmux boot +
cc-save machine). Tests + smoke mandatory; verify live that each agent kind round-trips.

## (DONE via PR #33) dashboard problematic-models badge — built, not a pending ROADMAP item
[36] review dashboard per-model health + problematic-count badge on Models&roles tab — delivered as
DRAFT PR #33 (review-cli), 61 tests + smoke, screenshot badge=4. Tracked on GitHub, not pending here.

## OWED: gh ship must work in every repo via provisioning, not a runtime alias hack (CTO 2026-06-17, #3975)
`gh ship` is a gh alias → `<repo>/.claude/scripts/pr-ship.sh`, which only EXISTS in agent-tools (it
delegates to `ci/ship/ship.sh`). In rig-cli/review-cli/tg-cli the delegator was MISSING → `gh ship`
failed there. STOPGAP applied now: improved the gh alias to fall back to the canonical
`~/xp/agent-tools/ci/ship/ship.sh` when no repo-local `pr-ship.sh` exists (unblocks the merge wave).
DURABLE deliverable still OWED (CTO wants it PR'd + reviewed + merged): rig (or the agent-tools
installer) must PROVISION `.claude/scripts/pr-ship.sh` into every managed repo so `gh ship` works
everywhere on a clean machine — AND handle gitignore so the provisioned file doesn't dirty the tree
(ship refuses a dirty worktree). Then drop the alias fallback. Test + review iterations + merge.

## FOLLOW-UPS from the merge wave (2026-06-17)
- **tg-cli #36 merged but NOT deployed:** the lowercase-english `--tag` + help-color landed on tg-cli
  `main`, but the LIVE `tg` is `~/.files/bin/tg` (1.11.0), a separate checkout. `answer`/`decision`/
  etc. won't work in the live tg until ~/.files is synced/rebuilt from tg-cli. Deploy step owed.
- **review-cli stray-commit branch:** `salvage-readme-agenttools-fix` preserves local-main commit
  5d7c957 (docs readme fix) that an agent made directly on the main checkout; it appears to DUPLICATE
  already-merged #27-readme (0748b8a). Verify and delete the branch if redundant.
- **multi-agent restore (#3972) recorded but NOT started** — codex/opencode/commandcode session
  restore in cc-save/cc-restore. Delegate after the merge wave settles.

## DONE 2026-06-17: merge wave — all 9 PRs landed (CTO "лей" #3974/#3975)
Shipped via `gh ship` (after fixing the alias to work outside agent-tools): review-cli #32/#34/#33,
rig-cli #28/#27/#29/#30, agent-tools #52, tg-cli #36 (--skip-ci for 8 pre-existing CodeQL findings).
#23 closed as superseded by #29. rig-cli #27/#29/#30 each needed a serial rebase onto the advancing
main (all touch the same provisioning files) + codex P2 thread fixes — done by subagents, verified
green (smoke exit 0 + CI) before each ship.
FINDING worth fixing: the CI `review-threads` gate reads GREEN while `gh ship` still refuses for
unresolved codex threads — the two gates use different criteria, so a PR looks merge-ready in CI but
ship blocks. Align them (do X: make the CI review-threads check enforce ship's all-resolved rule,
because Y: green CI currently misrepresents thread state and wasted merge cycles).
FOLLOW-UP: worktree hygiene — prune the merged-branch + /tmp/wt-* worktrees across rig-cli/review-cli
and the salvage branches (salvage-readme-agenttools-fix) now that the wave is done.

## Forward harness confirmation / permission prompts to TG as inline buttons (CTO 2026-06-17)
The agent harness's BLOCKING prompts must MIRROR to Telegram as tappable inline buttons, not only
render in the tmux pane. Trigger that surfaced it: the dynamic-**workflow launch** confirm dialog
("Run a dynamic workflow? 1. Yes, run it / 2. View raw script / 3. No") appeared ONLY in the pane —
a backgrounded/remote run stalls on a prompt the CTO never sees from the phone, or it just auto-runs
without the chance to say no. Scope: detect the harness prompt state (Claude Code workflow-confirm +
tool-permission + plan-approval prompts at minimum; generalize to codex/opencode/etc.), push the
prompt text + its option list to TG as inline buttons, and route the tap back as the selection /
keystroke into the pane (or via the harness prompt API). This EXTENDS decisions-as-buttons
(#3706, tg-cli#30): same inline-button + routed-reply infra, and it MUST honor the pending-question
DEFER (tg-ctl must not blast injected text into a pane that has an open prompt — see tg-cli#30).
Tracking: extend tg-cli#30 (or a new tg-cli issue).

## INCIDENT 2026-06-17 ~09:52: tmux died (spawn-storm, not reboot/OOM) + restore machinery built-but-not-deployed
Read-only forensics. The machine did NOT reboot (uptime ~12h45, boot prev-day 21:18) and did NOT OOM
(~17 GB free, no jetsam on tmux, no `.ips` crash report). The old server (PID 9214) continuum heartbeat
collapsed during a **`tmux`-command spawn-storm ~09:51-09:53** — hundreds of short-lived one-shot `tmux`
invocations, consistent with the **185 leftover `rigtest-*`/`ccdbg-*`/`tgctl-test-*` sockets** in
/private/tmp/tmux-501/. The actual SIGKILL/SIGTERM was not logged, so the exact terminator is unprovable;
strongest circumstantial read = a rig/test loop's tmux-socket churn starved/killed the server. ACTION:
find+stop whatever loops `tmux` (the `rigtest-*` socket factory) and clean the 185 stale test sockets; rig
tests must use throwaway sockets they tear down in a trap.
Why the manual restart restored NOTHING (all already in §5b / "v2 reboot", DOCUMENTED but NOT DEPLOYED):
- **cc not resumed**: deployed `~/.config/rig/tmux/cc-save.sh` matches `pane_current_command == claude`, but
  a live cc pane reports `2.1.179` (cc's versioned node binary name) -> never matches -> `cc-sessions.map`
  is 0 bytes -> cc-restore has nothing. Fix (in rig's TEMPLATE, not a hand-patch of the provisioned file):
  detect cc by walking the pane pid-tree for the claude/node process, not by command-string. Highest value.
- **zsh profile missing in panes**: the heavy profile (zplug, spaceship prompt, gs/gpf aliases, full PATH)
  lives only in `~/.zprofile` (LOGIN shells); `.zshrc` is 4 lines. tmux `default-command ''` spawns
  NON-login panes -> only `.zshrc` runs. Fix: `set -g default-command "$SHELL -l"` in rig.tmux.conf.
- **launchd boot = empty server**: `ai.hyperide.tmux-boot.plist` runs bare `tmux start-server` (no session
  -> no conf/plugins/continuum-restore). Point it at a script that does `new-session -d` (rig tmux-boot.sh).
- **duplicate boot agent**: a legacy `~/Library/LaunchAgents/Tmux.Start.plist` (continuum
  `osx_iterm_start_tmux.sh`) competes with rig's agent. Unload+remove it. This — NOT an `ln`/`.ln.conf`
  wrapper — is the real "two wrappers"; CORRECT the §5b note: there is NO `ln`/`.ln.conf` on this machine.
- **session sprawl**: the manual bare `tmux` bypassed `attach -t main || new -s main` -> 4 sessions (2/3/4/main).
GOOD NEWS: the Moshi `status-right ''` continuum-wipe did NOT bite this time — rig's ordering fix held
(status-right intact under MOSHI_CLIENT=1). All fixes belong in **rig tmux provisioning** (§5b), not hand-edits.
**ROOT CAUSE — RESOLVED 2026-06-17 (corrects the "spawn-storm/unprovable" read above):** a killer subagent
PROVED the mechanism — `tmux kill-server` ends the server process but does NOT unlink the socket file on
macOS, so test fixtures that `kill-server` without unlinking LEAK one socket inode per run. Two leakers:
rig-cli `tests/test_tmux_e2e.py` (fixture `tmux_env`, `rigtest-<uuid>` — 157 of the 166) and tg-cli
`tests/ctl-tmux-integration.test.ts` (`afterAll`, `tgctl-test-<pid>`). The "spawn-storm" I saw WAS these
fixtures churning sockets. FIX (PRs open, NOT merged): rig-cli **#31** + tg-cli **#37** — teardown now kills
the server AND unlinks the socket, + a regression test asserting no leak. Tests green (rig-cli 660 + 6 e2e,
tg-cli 1015 bun); reviews caught+fixed 2 real bugs (env-mismatch socket path, kill-timeout skips unlink).
166 stale sockets cleaned to 0; live session intact.
Follow-ups: (a) rig-cli leak regression is gated behind `RIG_TMUX_E2E=1` + GitHub-reachability -> decouple
into a tmux-only no-network check; (b) `ati-test-*` (14) + `ccdbg-*` (3) debris has NO source in any managed
repo -> trace which tool makes them so it gets the same kill+unlink fix; (c) prune worktrees after merge
(`~/xp/rig-cli-worktrees/fix-tmux-socket-leak`, `~/.files/repos/tg-cli-wt-socketleak`).

## require-review-before-commit hook is too broad + ignores the env bypass (found 2026-06-17)
The `require-review-before-commit` agent-hook blocks a commit when no fresh review marker
(`~/.cache/agent-tools/last-review`, mtime-windowed) exists — but: (1) it fires on a pure **docs-only**
change (e.g. a ROADMAP.md edit), where the project rule explicitly allows skipping review; (2) it also
catches `git stash` (any persisting git op), so you can't even park a docs edit; (3) it does NOT honor
`REVIEW_SKIP=1` / `REVIEW_MARKER=...` passed as INLINE ENV on the git command — the hook reads the marker
FILE / its own process env, not the to-be-run command's env, so `REVIEW_MARKER=x git commit` is ignored
(the error message advertises `REVIEW_MARKER` as if inline would work). Net: a docs commit forces either a
full multi-model `review` run (heavy, and a crash-risk when other agents are already reviewing) or a touch
of the GLOBAL marker (which then lets concurrent code agents' commits skip the gate inside the 1h window).
Fix: (a) detect docs-only diffs (paths match `*.md`/docs globs) and allow them, OR honor a real per-commit
skip — `git commit -m '... [skip-review: docs]'` trailer, or a `REVIEW_SKIP`/`REVIEW_MARKER` env the hook
actually reads from the command; (b) don't gate `git stash`/`git worktree` (non-commit ops). Pairs with the
"docs-only OK to skip review" rule. Tracking: agent-hooks (this repo).

## rig setup — interactive config wizard (CTO 2026-06-17)
`rig setup` is the INTERACTIVE wizard. It (1) SHOWS what is currently enabled/configured — the live
state across ALL reconciled areas (skills, agent-hooks, git-hooks, CI, MCP, harness/auto-mode, repo
settings, tmux, model-cron — the same areas `rig status` covers), and (2) lets you CHANGE anything in
BOTH the local (`rig.yaml`) and global (`~/.config/rig/config.yaml`) config from inside the wizard, then
APPLY (`rig apply`) so the change takes effect on the spot. Each option carries an inline HINT explaining
how it works and why it's needed (the "why" sits next to the toggle, not buried in docs).
NON-interactive `rig setup` (no TTY / piped / non-interactive run) just prints USAGE help for the core
commands: `init`, `apply`, `config get|set` — it degrades to a help/pointer, it does NOT run a
half-wizard. (Pairs with `rig config get|set` and the rig.yaml JSON-schema work in §5 — the wizard reads
the schema for the option list + hints. This REFINES/REVERSES the earlier "delete the `rig setup` alias"
item above: `rig setup` is no longer an alias, it IS the wizard; `init` (onboarding front door) and
`apply` (reconcile) stay distinct commands.)

## MISSING gate: "mandatory/relevant skills were READ before work" (CTO 2026-06-17)
There is NO hook that verifies an agent actually READ the mandatory + task-relevant skills before it
starts working. Today skill-loading is purely advisory — the frontmatter `description` triggers + the
SessionStart blurb SUGGEST skills, but NOTHING enforces that the universal-mandatory skills
(delegate-work-to-subagents, visual-proof-cycle) or the task-relevant ones were invoked before the agent
acts/commits. Need a GUARD (a new `agents-hooks/v1` point — e.g. a pre-work / first-substantive-tool gate,
carried into Claude Code via the `cc_hook_bridge`, same as the other gates) that checks the required
skills for the context were invoked this session/task and BLOCKS or warns otherwise. Design questions to
settle: what counts as "read" (Skill-tool invocation this session vs this task), which skills are
mandatory-always vs relevance-triggered (and how relevance is detected), and warn-vs-block tier. Pairs
with the skill-loading work (§9 — skills must actually LOAD) and the require-review-before-commit gate
(same hook-bridge carrier). Tracking: agent-hooks (this repo).

## DOCTRINE: enforce correct agent behavior with PreToolUse hooks (rig-provisioned), not prompts/promises (CTO 2026-06-17)
**Root lesson from this session:** behavioral rules that live only in prose (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, skills,
"I'll do better going forward") REGRESS — the agent forgets or rationalizes them within a few turns. The
CTO repeated the SAME corrections many times in one session (orchestrate-only; subagents in the
BACKGROUND; no long inline processes) because nothing ENFORCED them. A behavioral rule with no mechanism
is a promise, and promises regress. The fix is structural: encode each rule as an `agents-hooks/v1`
**PreToolUse** hook (carried into every harness via `cc_hook_bridge`), provisioned UNIVERSALLY by rig
(rig.yaml agent-hooks layer, default-on), self-dogfooded here. Build these, each its own descriptor under
`agent-hooks/<name>/`:

1. **background-subagent gate** (PreToolUse on the Agent/Task dispatch tool). If the ORCHESTRATOR launches
   a subagent WITHOUT `run_in_background: true` (and it isn't a trivial one-liner), BLOCK (exit 10) with a
   3-part reminder: "the orchestrator must dispatch subagents in the BACKGROUND — set
   `run_in_background: true` or use a dynamic Workflow; a foreground subagent blocks the main thread." This
   is the CTO's specific ask: detect that the main agent is about to launch a subagent NOT in the
   background and remind/block with the right way. Detect: `tool in {Agent, Task}` and `run_in_background != true`.
2. **orchestrator-stays-thin gate** (PreToolUse on Edit/Write/Bash, MAIN thread only). When the main thread
   attempts non-trivial work itself — a code Edit/Write (non-docs), or a multi-step/long Bash — WARN then
   BLOCK with "delegate to a subagent; the orchestrator plans, dispatches, verifies — it doesn't implement
   inline." (delegate-work-to-subagents, enforced.)
3. **no-long-inline-process gate** (PreToolUse on Bash, MAIN thread only). Detect long-running commands in
   the orchestrator (`review`, `* --watch`, `gh pr checks --watch`, build/test suites, `sleep`) and BLOCK:
   "run this in a background subagent, not the orchestrator." Pattern-match the command.
4. **skills-read gate** — the separate "MISSING gate" item above (verify mandatory/relevant skills were
   invoked before work).
5. **visual-proof gate** — block a commit / "done" claim on a user-visible change with no attached
   screenshot the agent actually looked at (visual-proof-cycle, enforced).

**Fighting the RIGIDITY (equally important — a gate that can't be satisfied is as bad as no gate):** the
require-review-before-commit hook is this session's cautionary tale — its marker was UNSATISFIABLE
(nothing wrote it) and it gated even docs/`git stash`, so it forced agents to either STALL or "forge" the
marker. So every enforcement hook MUST be: (a) **satisfiable** by an honest action (and that action must
exist + be wired — e.g. `review` must actually write its marker); (b) **tiered** — warn before block where
feasible, so a brittle rule doesn't wedge the whole loop; (c) **scoped** — SUBAGENTS are EXEMPT from
gates 1-3 (a subagent legitimately does the work + runs review + ships); this needs a reliable
main-thread-vs-subagent signal (an env var the harness/bridge sets); (d) **honest escape hatch** — a
real, auditable skip (a commit trailer / documented flag the hook reads), never a silent forge. rig
provisions all of them via the agent-hooks layer + `cc_hook_bridge`; `rig status` reports drift; they are
default-ON so a fresh machine inherits the enforcement. Tracking: agent-hooks (this repo) + rig provisioning.

## MISSING universal-mandatory skill: extract lessons from process mistakes + user complaints (CTO 2026-06-17)
There is NO skill that mandates SELF-LEARNING — turning a process mistake or a user
complaint/correction into a durably-recorded lesson. Checked: the 38 universal skills include
`promise-durable-action` (turn a promise into a mechanism — that's the DOWNSTREAM step) and
`task-completion-selfcheck` (end-of-task reflection), but NOTHING covers the upstream act of NOTICING a
recurring failure / a user's repeated correction and EXTRACTING + recording the generalizable lesson. The
proof it's needed is this very session: the CTO had to repeat the same corrections many times
(orchestrate-only; subagents in the background; no long inline processes) because the lesson was never
captured — it stayed an apology, not a durable change.
**Author a new universal-MANDATORY skill** (e.g. `learn-from-feedback` / `capture-lessons-durably`,
skills/universal/, English-only, follow writing-skills, GREEN-verified). Trigger: ANY user
complaint/correction, OR a self-noticed process failure (a repeated mistake, a tool that didn't behave as
the user expected, a workflow that failed the same way twice). Mandate: do NOT just apologize and fix the
instance — (1) name the ROOT cause, (2) extract the GENERALIZABLE lesson, (3) durably record it in the
right place: a `MEMORY.md` memory file for cross-session/behavioral lessons, a ROADMAP/ticket entry for a
project process gap, and — if it's a behavioral rule — escalate it to ENFORCEMENT (a hook/skill/config
change) per the doctrine above. It is MANDATORY-ALWAYS (every agent, every session), in the same tier as
`delegate-work-to-subagents` / `visual-proof-cycle`. Pairs with `promise-durable-action` (the mechanism
step it feeds into), `task-completion-selfcheck`, and the enforcement DOCTRINE above. ENFORCEMENT hook
(ties into that doctrine): after a user message that reads as a correction/complaint, a PreToolUse/Stop
nudge "extract + durably record the lesson before moving on" — so self-learning itself isn't just another
prose promise. Tracking: skills/universal + agent-hooks (this repo).
