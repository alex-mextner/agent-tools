"""agenttools_service.core — one reusable service-manager for every long-running server.

WHAT THIS FILE IS
    The engine behind :class:`ServiceManager`. A :class:`Service` descriptor names a
    long-running server (its ``argv``, a default ``port``, and where its pidfile / logfile /
    autostart unit live). :class:`ServiceManager` gives that server the identical lifecycle
    subcommands every daemon in the ecosystem wants:

        run      — foreground/blocking (this shell), for ``disable``d / ad-hoc use.
        start    — background detached daemon; writes a pidfile, returns immediately.
        status   — {running, pid, port, url} from the pidfile + a liveness probe.
        stop     — stop the background instance, remove the pidfile.
        enable   — install OS autostart (launchd / systemd --user / a no-systemd fallback)
                   AND start it in the background now.
        disable  — remove autostart AND stop.

    A bare invocation (no subcommand) returns HELP — it NEVER launches anything.

HOW IT'S REACHED AT RUNTIME
    A consumer (``review dashboard``, ``config-web``, ``tg-ctl``, a future daemon) builds a
    :class:`Service`, wraps it in a :class:`ServiceManager`, and wires
    ``add_service_subcommands(...)`` into its argparse so ``<tool> <service>
    run|start|stop|status|enable|disable`` dispatches to the manager. The same machinery the
    roadmap wants shared by tg-ctl autostart + the daemon-supervisor (§3).

INVARIANTS / DESIGN
    - **Stdlib only at import time.** ``os`` / ``sys`` / ``shutil`` / ``subprocess`` /
      ``socket`` / ``pathlib`` / ``dataclasses`` / ``typing``. Zero third-party deps, so a
      consumer's ``--help`` stays fast and offline. The ONLY in-ecosystem dependency is
      ``agenttools_daemon`` (also stdlib-only), reused for the pidfile + start/stop/status
      machinery rather than reimplementing it (shared-util single source).
    - **Pidfile is the cross-process source of truth** — delegated to
      ``agenttools_daemon.Supervisor``. ``start`` writes it, ``stop`` reads+removes it,
      ``status`` reads+probes it. A ``stop`` in a different process finds the daemon via the
      file alone.
    - **Background = detached.** ``start`` spawns ``argv`` with ``start_new_session=True`` so
      the daemon outlives the launching shell; stdout/stderr go to the service's logfile.
    - **Autostart is pluggable + idempotent + removable.** ``enable``/``disable`` go through
      an :class:`AutostartBackend` chosen by OS: launchd LaunchAgent on macOS, a systemd
      ``--user`` unit on Linux with ``systemctl`` present, else a no-op fallback that still
      lets ``start``/``stop`` work (just no boot-survival). Re-running ``enable`` overwrites
      the unit in place (no duplicates); ``disable`` removes it and is a no-op if absent.
    - **Everything OS/process/path-related is injectable.** ``home`` / ``platform`` /
      ``has_systemctl`` / ``spawner`` / ``runner`` / ``alive`` are all parameters, so the
      whole manager — INCLUDING enable/disable and the launchd/systemd unit generation — is
      tested under a tmp HOME with fakes, touching no real autostart and no real process.

PAST BUGS THIS GUARDS AGAINST
    - A "service" CLI where the bare command launches the server is a footgun: a user typing
      ``review dashboard`` to read help accidentally starts a daemon. Here the bare path is
      HELP-only; launching requires an explicit ``start``/``run``/``enable``.
    - Hand-rolled autostart that appends a fresh LaunchAgent/unit on every ``enable`` leaves
      duplicates that fight at boot. ``enable`` is idempotent: it writes the unit to a
      deterministic path, overwriting.
    - Per-tool copies of this logic drift (slightly different pidfile formats, one forgets
      the systemd fallback, one launches on the bare command). One shared manager keeps every
      daemon's lifecycle identical.
    - ``stop``/``disable`` used to report an unqualified success ("stopped" / "disabled and
      stopped") purely from the pidfile's point of view — but the pidfile only tracks a
      MANAGER-spawned instance. An ad-hoc, unmanaged process bound to the same port (e.g.
      ``review dashboard run``) has no pidfile at all, so ``stop``/``disable`` could not see
      it and still claimed success while it kept running and holding the port (agent-tools
      review-cli#377). ``ServiceManager.probe_port`` now checks the port itself, after
      acting, and ``run_action`` warns + exits nonzero instead of lying about success.

        The service id — used to name the pidfile, logfile, and autostart unit. Keep it a
        filesystem- and label-safe slug (``[A-Za-z0-9_.-]``); it is validated on construction.

        The command that runs the server **in the foreground** (the thing ``run`` blocks on
        and ``start`` detaches). A list/tuple of strings, e.g.
        ``["review", "dashboard", "run"]`` or ``[sys.executable, "-m", "mytool.server"]``.
    port
        The default TCP port the server listens on (used to build ``url`` for ``status``).
        ``None`` if the service is not a network server.
    host
        The host the ``url`` should point at (display only). Defaults to ``127.0.0.1``.
    tool
        The owning tool name, used to namespace the autostart label
        (``com.agenttools.<tool>.<name>`` / ``agenttools-<tool>-<name>``). Defaults to
        ``name`` when omitted.
    description
        A one-line human description, surfaced in the generated unit + ``--help``.
    home
        The home directory under which state/cache live. Injected by tests (a tmp HOME);

        ``$XDG_STATE_HOME/<tool>`` (fallback ``~/.local/state/<tool>``); the cache dir

    The pidfile + start/stop/status machinery is delegated to

    delegated to an :class:`AutostartBackend` chosen by OS. All OS/process seams are
    injectable so the whole manager is testable under a tmp HOME with no real side effects.

    Parameters
    ----------
    service
        The :class:`Service` to manage.
    platform
        The platform key (defaults to :func:`current_platform`); pinned by tests.
    has_systemctl
        Whether ``systemctl`` is available (Linux autostart selection). ``None`` ⇒ probe.
    autostart
        An explicit :class:`AutostartBackend` (overrides OS selection); mainly for tests.
        NOTE: when you pass ``autostart=`` explicitly, ``runner=`` is NOT applied to it (the
        explicit backend carries its own ``runner``) — set the runner on the backend you pass.
        ``runner=`` only configures the auto-selected backend.
    spawner
        ``Callable[[argv, logfile], Child]`` that detaches the background daemon. Defaults to
        a ``subprocess.Popen`` with ``start_new_session=True`` and stdout/stderr → logfile.
        ``start_new_session`` is POSIX-only; on Windows the spawned process is not fully
        detached (pass a Windows-specific spawner if you need boot/login survival there).
    runner
        The autostart control-command runner passed to the AUTO-SELECTED backend. Ignored when
        ``autostart=`` is given explicitly (that backend owns its own runner).
    alive
        Liveness probe passed through to the Supervisor (``os.kill(pid, 0)`` by default).
    signaller
        ``Callable[[pid, sig], None]`` passed through to the Supervisor for the cross-process
        ``stop`` signal (``os.kill`` by default). Injected in tests.
    foreground_runner
        ``Callable[[argv], int]`` used by ``run`` to block on the foreground process.
        Defaults to ``subprocess.call`` (returns the exit code). Injected in tests.
    port_probe
        ``Callable[[host, port], PortProbe]`` used by :meth:`probe_port` to check whether
        something is listening on the service's port, independent of the pidfile. Defaults to
        :func:`_default_port_prober` (a real TCP connect + best-effort ``lsof`` lookup).
        Injected in tests so the suite never dials a real socket.
    sleeper
        ``Callable[[seconds], None]`` used ONLY by :func:`_run_action_disable`'s post-teardown
        settle-and-re-probe (an OS-managed ``launchctl unload``/``systemctl disable --now``
        can return before the process has actually released the port — see that function's
        docstring). Defaults to ``time.sleep``. Injected in tests so the suite waits zero

    common case IS an ad-hoc/unmanaged process this manager never tracked, but two edge cases
    make a flat "not ours" claim occasionally false — a forked child that inherited the

    process that survived ``agenttools_daemon.Supervisor``'s SIGTERM/SIGKILL escalation
    (``Supervisor.stop`` reports success once the *original* pid is confirmed dead, which does
    not guarantee an inherited fd was closed). Either way the fact worth reporting is the same
    — the port is occupied right now, regardless of `stop`/`disable`'s own success — so the
