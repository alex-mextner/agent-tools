"""Rig-aware install-hook delegation — the one place every ecosystem CLI asks
"is rig here? then let rig own the hooks."

WHAT / WHY
==========
Every ecosystem CLI (tg-ctl, review, ...) ships an ``install-hooks`` command that
writes agent-harness hooks directly (``~/.claude/settings.json``,
``~/.codex/hooks.json``, ...). When ``rig`` is also installed on the machine, those
direct writers become a SECOND source of truth for the same hooks — the exact
duplication that makes codex warn ``loading hooks from both ...`` and that lets two
tools fight over one file.

This module is the shared decision every such command makes at its top:

    if rig is present  -> DELEGATE to rig (``rig apply`` / ``rig config set``); rig is
                          the single source of truth and provisions the hooks.
    if rig is absent   -> run the tool's own direct installer (the FALLBACK), so a
                          machine without rig still gets working hooks.

HOW IT IS REACHED AT RUNTIME
============================
- Python CLIs (review-cli, ...) ``import agenttools_rig_delegate`` and call
  :func:`delegate_or_fallback`.
- Non-Python CLIs (tg-ctl is a bun/TS binary) cannot import Python, so they shell out
  to the ``__main__`` CLI: ``python3 -m agenttools_rig_delegate ...``. The CLI mirrors
  the library contract exactly (see ``__main__.py``); keep the two in sync.

INVARIANTS
==========
- Stdlib only. No third-party imports at module load (mirrors the ecosystem rule).
- Detection is robust: rig is "present" iff a runnable ``rig`` resolves — either on
  ``PATH`` or at a well-known install location. A rig *checkout* on disk is NOT enough
  on its own (a source tree is not an installed CLI); we only treat an executable as
  present. This keeps the fallback firing on machines that merely cloned the repo.
- Delegation NEVER silently falls back on a rig error. Fallback is for "no rig", not
  "rig failed" — a rig that is present but errors is a real failure to surface, else we
  would double-write the very hooks we set out to consolidate.
