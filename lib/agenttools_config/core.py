"""Two-layer config cascade loader — path resolution + deep merge + pluggable validate.

WHAT THIS FILE IS
    The engine behind ``agenttools_config.load_config``. It resolves the two layer paths
    (global ``~/.config/<tool>/config.yaml`` honoring ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME``; per-repo
    ``<tool>.yaml`` at the repo root), parses each present layer, deep-merges them with
    the per-repo layer winning, then runs an optional caller-supplied ``schema_validate``
    hook on the result.

HOW IT'S REACHED AT RUNTIME
    A CLI calls ``load_config(tool="...", repo_root=...)`` early in a command (after it
    has located the repo root). The returned :class:`LoadedConfig` carries the merged
    ``data`` plus provenance (which absolute paths each layer came from, and the ordered
    ``layers`` list) so the CLI can show "loaded global + repo" in ``status``/``doctor``.

INVARIANTS / PAST BUGS
    - ``yaml`` is imported LAZILY inside ``_load_yaml`` — importing this module must not
      require PyYAML (the ecosystem's lazy-heavy-imports rule; ``--help`` stays usable
      offline / dependency-free).
    - The merge replaces lists wholesale (atomic), and merges nested dicts recursively.
      This matches ``rig-cli``'s reference semantics; appending lists was rejected there
      as unpredictable. Do NOT "improve" it to concatenate without changing the docs and
      every consumer's expectations.
    - Path resolution reads ``XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` from the environment on EVERY call (not
      cached at import) so tests and per-process overrides take effect.

    `deep_merge` is safe to *call* repeatedly, but mutating a list/leaf *inside the result*
