# opencode-hook-bridge - fire `agents-hooks/v1` hooks inside opencode

opencode has a native plugin surface, but it does not read the agent-tools
`agents-hooks/v1` descriptor directory by itself. This bridge is the carrier rig
symlinks into opencode's project plugin directory so the same installed descriptors
can run under opencode.

## What it does

The JavaScript plugin handles:

```
tool.execute.before
tool.execute.after
```

The plugin module exports a single named plugin function, `AgentToolsHookBridge`.
It intentionally does not export a default plugin object; rig provisions this file
as the opencode plugin entrypoint and the bridge tests pin the export shape.

For each event it invokes:

```
python3 -m opencode_hook_bridge <event>
```

The Python dispatcher reads the plugin payload from stdin, maps it to a logical v1
point, runs matching descriptors from `~/.config/opencode/hooks/*.json`, and returns
plain block JSON to the plugin:

```json
{"decision":"block","reason":"..."}
```

The plugin throws `Error(reason)` when it receives a block decision for
`tool.execute.before`, which is the opencode plugin contract for blocking a tool
call before the side effect. For `tool.execute.after`, the write has already
happened, so a block decision is logged as feedback and the plugin fails open.

## Mapping

| opencode plugin event/tool | v1 point | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tool.execute.before` + `bash` | `pre-bash` | `output.args.command` becomes `event.command` and `args.command`. |
| `tool.execute.before` + `edit` / `write` | `pre-write` | `output.args.filePath` is normalized to `args.file_path` / `args.path`; proposed content is normalized to `args.content`. |
| `tool.execute.before` + `apply_patch` | `pre-write` | `output.args.patchText` becomes raw `args.patch`; added patch lines become `args.content`; patch marker paths become `args.file_path` / `args.path`. |
| `tool.execute.before` + `task` | `pre-agent` | Carries the task payload (`subagent_type`, `prompt`, `description`) for orchestration guards. opencode Task is inherently async and has no `background` field; `general`/`explore` therefore pass the background-subagent gate. |
| `tool.execute.after` + `edit` / `write` / `apply_patch` | `post-write` | Runs path-based hooks after the write; exit 10 is logged as feedback because opencode cannot un-run the completed write. |

opencode has session events such as `session.idle`, but this bridge does not map
them to the v1 `stop` point: opencode documents them as plugin notifications, not
as a pre-stop blocking contract.

For multi-file `apply_patch` calls, the dispatcher fans out one v1 event per file
path. If one patch contains multiple separate blocks for the same file path, the
per-file `args.content` value reflects the last block seen for that path. For move
patches, both the source and destination paths are surfaced for path-based gates;
only the destination receives the added-content payload because the source path is
not being written.

The bridge strips all opencode tool-argument fields that look like agent identity
(`agent_id`, `agent_type`, camelCase variants, and `agent`). Those fields are not
trusted as a non-forgeable subagent identity in the plugin payload, so
subagent-exempt hooks treat opencode tool calls as main-thread calls unless a future
opencode contract exposes an authoritative identity field.

Every translated v1 event also carries a top-level `harness: "opencode"` — a hardcoded
module constant (`dispatch.HARNESS`), never derived from the opencode event, so it can't be
forged via tool args the way the identity fields above must be actively stripped. A hook
that needs to scope a policy to (or exempt) one harness reads `event["harness"]` directly
(see `agent-hooks/orchestrator-stays-thin`'s harness-exempt list for the first consumer,
agent-tools#533) instead of trying to reconstruct a trusted subagent identity.

## Descriptor directory

By default the bridge reads:

```
~/.config/opencode/hooks
```

Tests and manual runs can override it:

```
OPENCODE_HOOKS_DIR=/tmp/hooks python3 -m opencode_hook_bridge tool.execute.before
```

## Installation (via rig)

Rig provisions two opencode paths when `harness.kind: opencode` and
`harness.hook_bridge.enabled` are active:

- descriptor JSON files in `~/.config/opencode/hooks`
- this plugin symlinked into the repo-local `.opencode/plugins/zz-agent-tools-hook-bridge.js`

The repo-local ordered plugin path is intentional. opencode's documented plugin
source order runs global plugins before project `.opencode/plugins`; a global-only
security bridge could approve tool arguments before a later project plugin mutates
them. Rig therefore installs the bridge as a `zz-` project plugin so it runs after
normal project plugins and observes the final tool arguments before execution.

opencode loads plugins only at startup, so restart opencode after `rig apply`.

## Fail policy

The JS plugin gives the dispatcher a bounded top-level timeout (default 1,000,000 ms,
override with `OPENCODE_HOOK_BRIDGE_TIMEOUT_MS`). The default deliberately exceeds
the longest shipped descriptor budget so it catches a wedged dispatcher without
preempting fail-closed hooks that intentionally wait for approval. If the dispatcher
times out before a tool executes, the plugin blocks because it cannot prove the v1
checks ran. After a write has already landed, timeout is logged as feedback and the
plugin fails open. Malformed stdin, invalid dispatcher JSON, a dispatcher bug, or an
unreadable descriptor directory logs to stderr and allows the opencode action. A
loaded descriptor still honors v1 semantics: exit 10 blocks pre-tool calls, exit 0
allows, and other hook failures resolve through the descriptor's `on_error` policy.
