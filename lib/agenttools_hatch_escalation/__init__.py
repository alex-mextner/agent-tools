"""Shared Telegram hatch escalation helper for agent-hook scripts.

The helper is intentionally small and stdlib-only: hook scripts import it directly from the
agent-tools checkout, before package installation can be assumed. It turns a per-hook env var
(`RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_<HOOK_ID>`) into a one-time `tg-ctl ask` call through a trusted absolute
path. It never consults ambient PATH.

Every attempt where the hatch env var carried ANY value is also appended, best-effort, as one
JSON line to `overrides.log` (retrospective 2026-07-01, section 5.2.3 item 3 / gap G-8: "escape
hatches have no audit sink"). See `_append_overrides_log` for the record shape and trust model.

# ── Delegation recipes (agent-tools#573) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Every subagent-aware gate refuses with "delegate this" — and the way to delegate is DIFFERENT
# per harness. Before #573 the refusal text named Claude Code's Agent tool only, so a codex/omp
# session was told to use a tool it does not have (the origin of the 184 unusable refusals in
# Alex's codex session, and of the #533/#544 harness-wide exemption that #573 removed). The gates
# read the v1 event's top-level `harness` tag (a bridge-set module literal, never `args`) and ask
# this ONE table for the recipe; a missing/unknown tag gets every recipe, because an event that is
# governed must still be actionable. This module is the home for the same reason #560 chose it for
# its (now withdrawn) allowlist: every gated hook already hard-loads it through the hardened
# `_load_hatch_escalation` bootstrap, so no second bootstrap copy is needed. Stdlib-only, no
# sibling `lib/` imports — `tests/test_hatch_import_hardening.py` pins that.
#
# The launcher paths are the rig-PROVISIONED skill copies (`~/.agents/skills/<skill>/<launcher>`,
# the default `skills_target`, default-on via `skills.universal.all`) — `bin/` in the agent-tools
# repo is not a rig-discovered carrier (PR #497). `tests/test_agenttools_hatch_escalation.py` and
# `tests/test_background_subagent_gate.py` pin the paths to the carrier.

    anything after the executable is an argument, not an assignment. The command is tokenized

    The hook gates and — on approval — allows the ENTIRE Bash command as one unit, and the

    SECURITY: the approval binary (`tg-ctl`) is resolved from the account's REAL home
    (`resolve_home`) plus a hardcoded trusted-path list — NEVER from `cwd`, which the guarded
    agent controls. `cwd` here is used ONLY for the human-facing question context (the "CWD:"
    line). This is what stops a guarded agent from committing a repo-local `rig.yaml` with
    `agent_hooks.tg_ctl_path: /tmp/always-exit-0` and self-approving.

    The justification is read from EITHER of two sources, checked in this precedence order:

    1. The hook process environment (`env`, defaulting to `os.environ`) — set when the agent
       harness itself was launched with the var exported. This is the ONLY source available to
       pre-write (Edit/Write) hooks, which have no shell command string to parse.
    2. A leading inline `RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_<HOOK_ID>=<value>` assignment on the Bash `command`
       string (pass `command=` from a pre-bash hook). This is the documented inline form
       (`RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_X="why" <gated-command>`). A pre-bash hook runs in its OWN process
       BEFORE the shell evaluates that `VAR=x cmd` prefix, so the value never reaches the hook's
       `os.environ` — it must be parsed out of the command string that the event carries. Only
       this hook's specific var is honored; arbitrary leading assignments are ignored.

    A process-env value takes precedence over an inline one (an explicit export is the more
    deliberate signal), so passing `command=` is purely additive and never changes the behavior
    of an already-exported var.

    Unset (in both sources) means "hatch not requested" and does not block later mechanisms. A
    present but blank/bare-flag value is an invalid request: no Telegram call is made and the
    hook should deny rather than falling through to `approval_cmd`.

    Every attempt where the env var carries ANY value (blank, bare-flag, or a real justification —
    i.e. `env_present` ends up `True`) is a hatch USE and is appended, best-effort, to the
    escape-hatch audit sink as one JSON line (`overrides_log_path`, defaulting to
