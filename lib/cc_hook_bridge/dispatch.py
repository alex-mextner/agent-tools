"""The agents-hooks/v1 → Claude Code bridge dispatcher.

Reads a Claude Code hook event on stdin, runs the installed ``agents-hooks/v1``
descriptors that apply, and translates the v1 exit-10 BLOCK into CC's own block signal.

Confirmed CC contract (https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks, CC 2.1.177):
  - PreToolUse stdin : {tool_name, tool_input{}, cwd, permission_mode, hook_event_name, …};
                       when the action fires INSIDE a dispatched subagent the event ALSO
                       carries {agent_id, agent_type} — the reliable main-vs-subagent signal.
  - PreToolUse block : exit 0 + {"hookSpecificOutput": {"hookEventName": "PreToolUse",
                       "permissionDecision": "deny", "permissionDecisionReason": "..."}}
                       (we use the STRUCTURED JSON form, not exit 2, because it carries a
                       rich reason; exit 2 also blocks but discards any JSON.)
  - PostToolUse      : the tool already ran — cannot block; feedback via
                       {"decision": "block", "reason": "..."} (surfaces the reason to the
                       model, not un-running the tool). Maps to the `post-write` point for
                       the file-edit tools (format-on-write, lint-on-write).
  - Stop block       : exit 0 + {"decision": "block", "reason": "..."}.
  - matcher          : matched by CC against tool_name BEFORE we run; the settings.json entry
                       carries the matcher, so the dispatcher only needs the logical point.

agents-hooks/v1 (agent-hooks/README.md):
  - descriptor : {id, point, cmd (ABSOLUTE), args[], priority, timeout_ms, on_error}
  - hook stdin : {hook_api, event_id, tool, point, command, cwd, args{}}
  - hook exit  : 0 allow · 10 BLOCK (canonical, even if stdout malformed) · other → on_error
