"""The agents-hooks/v1 → Claude Code bridge dispatcher.

Reads a Claude Code hook event on stdin, runs the installed ``agents-hooks/v1``
descriptors that apply, and translates the v1 exit-10 BLOCK into CC's own block signal.

Confirmed CC contract (https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks, CC 2.1.177):
  - PreToolUse stdin : {tool_name, tool_input{}, cwd, permission_mode, hook_event_name, …};
                       when the action fires INSIDE a dispatched subagent the event ALSO
                       carries {agent_id, agent_type} — the reliable main-vs-subagent signal.
  - PreToolUse block : exit 0 + {"hookSpecificOutput": {"hookEventName": "PreToolUse",
                       "permissionDecision": "deny", "permissionDecisionReason": "..."}}
                       (we use the STRUCTURED JSON form, not exit 2, because it carries a
                       rich reason; exit 2 also blocks but discards any JSON.)
  - PostToolUse      : the tool already ran — cannot block; feedback via
                       {"decision": "block", "reason": "..."} (surfaces the reason to the
                       model, not un-running the tool). Maps to the `post-write` point for
                       the file-edit tools (format-on-write, lint-on-write).
  - Stop stdin       : {hook_event_name: "Stop", session_id, transcript_path, cwd,
                       stop_hook_active, …} — `transcript_path` points at the session's
                       JSONL transcript; forwarded into the v1 event so a `stop` hook can
                       read what actually happened this turn.
  - Stop block       : exit 0 + {"decision": "block", "reason": "..."}.
  - matcher          : matched by CC against tool_name BEFORE we run; the settings.json entry
                       carries the matcher, so the dispatcher only needs the logical point.

agents-hooks/v1 (agent-hooks/README.md):
  - descriptor : {id, point, cmd (ABSOLUTE), args[], priority, timeout_ms, on_error}
  - hook stdin : {hook_api, event_id, tool, point, command, cwd, args{}}
  - hook exit  : 0 allow · 10 BLOCK (canonical, even if stdout malformed) · other → on_error

# SUBAGENT from ever calling it: Monitor is categorically fire-and-forget (that is the whole
# point of the tool), and a dispatched subagent is NOT re-invoked by a MONITOR-EVENT
# notification — only the main loop is (Monitor has no harness-tracked child at all, unlike a
# Bash `run_in_background: true` child, which the harness DOES use to re-invoke its calling
# subagent — verified empirically; see subagent_no_monitor.py's docstring). Hit in HYP-1350's
# retrospective: a subagent called Monitor on its own spawned child process, then ended its
# turn awaiting a notification that only the top-level orchestrator ever receives. NOTE: the
# stated rationale of the sibling `subagent-no-bg-longproc` hook/AGENTS.md entry ("a subagent
# is never re-invoked by a background-completion notification") is broader than what this
# comment claims and does not hold for an ordinary backgrounded Bash command — tracked
# separately as agent-tools#546, out of scope for this mapping. The orchestrator's own Monitor
# use (watching a backgrounded subagent) is legitimate and unaffected — this point only
# governs subagent tool calls. Same two-repo split as `_AGENT_TOOLS`/`_SKILL_TOOLS` above:
# this half only maps the point, and rig-cli's `hook_bridge_entries` registers the `Monitor`
# PreToolUse matcher that makes it actually fire (rig-cli#296, shipped) — a given machine
# needs `rig apply` to have run after both merged, plus a fresh CC session (hook config is
# read at session start, not live), and the bridge itself enabled at all (see this module's
# README's Installation section) for the block to actually take effect.
