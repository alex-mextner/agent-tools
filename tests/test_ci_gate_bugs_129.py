"""Tests for the agent-tools#129 CI-gate fixes — the SHIPPED catalog gate scripts/workflows
that rig copies verbatim into every consumer, so a bug here is a bug in every rigged repo.

Run from the repo root::

    uv run --with pytest python -m pytest tests/test_ci_gate_bugs_129.py -q

Three classes of bug were fixed; each is asserted here against the REAL scripts/workflows:

1. dependency-review (SECURITY): the blocking gate ran the PR-checked-out script under plain
   `pull_request`, so a malicious PR could weaken the very gate it must pass. Fixed to the
   trusted-base `pull_request_target` model (mirrors leftover-grep / review-threads): the
   base-branch script runs; the PR's lockfiles are audited as DATA in a side worktree. We
   assert the workflow uses pull_request_target, runs the script from $GITHUB_WORKSPACE
   (the trusted base checkout), never `npm install`/`bun install`/checks out PR head onto the
   workspace, and that dep-audit.sh accepts an audit-dir arg and fails closed on a missing dir.
   The SECOND half of the bug: `setup-bun` was commented out, so a `bun.lock` repo fail-CLOSED
   (no `bun` on PATH -> dep-audit.sh's miss() reds CI). Fixed by shipping setup-bun ENABLED and
   SHA-pinned; we assert it is an active (uncommented), SHA-pinned step.

2. leftover-grep: a shallow head broke the three-dot merge-base diff and the script read the
   diff via a process substitution that swallowed `git diff` errors -> a block-tier gate could
   silently PASS having scanned nothing. Fixed to materialize the lines + check $? (fail
   closed), fail closed on an explicitly-requested base that doesn't resolve, and the workflow
   deepens the head fetch + verifies a merge-base. agent-tools#130 then closes the remaining
   gap: rather than fatal-and-block EVERY shallow PR on the unreachable three-dot merge base,
   the script falls back to the two-dot `base..HEAD` diff (no merge base needed) and keeps
   scanning; only a truly uncomputable head (a missing object) still fails closed. Also the
   `=======` conflict-marker false positive on a 7-`=` source separator is dropped (start/end
   markers still catch a real conflict). We exercise the real script for each.

3. codeql self-gate: the language-detect `git ls-files | grep -qiE` under `pipefail` returns
   141 (SIGPIPE) when grep matches early -> the `if` takes the else branch -> CodeQL silently
   SKIPS a language whose source IS present (the gate self-disables). Fixed to materialize the
   file list and grep a here-string with no -q pipe. We assert the buggy pattern is gone and
   reproduce that the new pattern detects.
