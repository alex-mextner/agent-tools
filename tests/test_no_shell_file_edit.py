"""Tests for the no-shell-file-edit agent-hook (pre-bash, hard block).

Covers the rule "edits only via Edit/Write; no sed/perl/awk for editing files":
  BLOCK     — `sed -i`/`perl -i`/`gawk -i inplace` on a tracked source file, a `> file` /
              `>> file` redirect onto a tracked source file, the same wrapped in `bash -c`.
  ALLOW     — read-only sed/awk/grep filters, a redirect to /tmp or a new/non-source file,
              `-i` on an untracked path, and the raw-string DECOYS that must NOT trip it
              (the flag inside a string operand / a comment / a commit message).
  HATCH     — deny-by-default Telegram escalation. The old ALLOW_SHELL_FILE_EDIT env +
              `# shell-file-edit-ok:` sentinel are DEAD; RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_NO_SHELL_FILE_EDIT
              with a written justification asks tg-ctl and allows only on exit 0, a bare `1` denies.

The tracked-source detection is exercised against a REAL temp git repo (no mock), so the
`git ls-files` boundary is what's actually under test.
