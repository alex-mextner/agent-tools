"""Tests for the block-devserver-primary agent-hook (pre-bash).

Covers the doctrine: launching a known dev-server command (npm run dev, vite, ...) is DENIED
while the effective cwd sits on the DEFAULT branch of an ENROLLED repo; a feature branch, an
un-enrolled repo, and a non-dev-server command are all ALLOWED; a literal leading `cd <dir> &&`
prefix is tracked so the command is judged against the TARGET directory, not the shell's own
cwd; the hatch escalation replaces the (nonexistent) self-service bypass; detached HEAD /
non-git fails OPEN.

Run from the repo root::

    uv run --with pytest python -m pytest tests/test_block_devserver_primary.py -q
