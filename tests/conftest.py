"""Shared pytest fixtures for the agent-tools suite.

The single most important one is `_hermetic_hatch_home`: it guarantees hatch approval tests cannot
reach the real `tg-ctl` (and message the human) via a developer's real `~/rig.yaml`. Since the
shared hatch lib now resolves the approval binary from the account's REAL home (`resolve_home`), a
machine that happens to have `~/rig.yaml` with `agent_hooks.tg_ctl_path` would let any hatch test
that patches only `_TRUSTED_TG_CTL_PATHS` invoke the real binary. Pointing `resolve_home` at a
clean temp home for tests closes that hole centrally. The two explicit real-OS-home tests below are
exempt from the home patch; they only assert `resolve_home()`'s source of truth and do not resolve
or execute `tg-ctl`.

It also exports `AGENT_TOOLS_OVERRIDES_LOG` (a full file path under the same clean temp home) for
every test. That env var is the escape-hatch audit sink's subprocess-reachable override (see
`agenttools_hatch_escalation._resolve_overrides_log_path`): several hook tests run the hook
script as a genuine SUBPROCESS (`subprocess.run([sys.executable, hook_path], ...)`), which gets a
brand-new interpreter that the `pwd.getpwuid`/`resolve_home` monkeypatches below never reach — so
without this env var, any subprocess test that sets the hatch env var to ANY value (even a bare
`1` that never contacts tg-ctl) would append a real audit line to the DEVELOPER'S real
`~/.config/agent-tools/overrides.log`. `monkeypatch.setenv` mutates the real process `os.environ`,
so a subprocess built from `dict(os.environ)` inherits this override automatically.

The module-level call right below (`_strip_ambient_ship_env`) closes the same class of hole for
`ci/ship/ship.sh`'s many gate-control knobs (`SHIP_EXTERNAL_REVIEW`, `SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM_ENABLED`,
`SHIP_SKIP_VERSION_BUMP`, ...). `tests/test_ship.py` builds each subprocess env as
`env = dict(os.environ)` and only pops a specific known set of ambient vars (`GH_REPO`,
`SHIP_TEST_DIFF`, ...) rather than every `SHIP_*`/`RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_SHIP_*` var, so a developer
shell that happens to export one of ship's gate switches silently changes what the test exercises
(caught live: this machine started exporting `SHIP_EXTERNAL_REVIEW=0` machine-wide, which disabled
the external-review gate in five tests written to exercise it as enabled). This is deliberately a
plain module-level `os.environ` mutation, run ONCE here at conftest import time, NOT a per-test
`monkeypatch.delenv` autouse fixture: `tests/test_ship.py` relies on its own module-level
`os.environ.setdefault("SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM", "0")` (also present in
`tests/test_ship_notify_task_cli.py`) plus `os.environ["SHIP_TASK_NOTIFY_ENABLED"] = "0"`
(test_ship.py only), applied once at each module's own collection time, which a per-test fixture
would strip during every test body (monkeypatch only restores the pre-test value AFTER each test's
teardown) — reintroducing exactly the ambient-enabled gates those defaults exist to turn off. Since
conftest.py is always imported before the test modules in this directory are collected, stripping
here first lets those modules' own one-time defaults apply cleanly against a guaranteed-clean
starting point.
