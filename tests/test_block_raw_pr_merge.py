"""Tests for agent-hooks/block-raw-pr-merge/block_raw_pr_merge.py.

Covers:
  - True positives: `gh pr merge <N>` is blocked
  - The argv-parse FP fix: commands whose body/args contain "gh pr merge" as TEXT
    (e.g. `gh pr create --body "...gh pr merge..."`) are ALLOWED
  - Sanctioned paths: `gh ship`, `pr-ship.sh`, `ship.sh` are allowed
  - Shell chains: `gh pr merge` behind `&&`/`;`/`||` is caught
  - Inline env assignments before `gh` are stripped
  - The DEAD self-service escape hatch (`ALLOW_RAW_PR_MERGE` / `# no-ship-guard:` no longer
    allow) and the external Telegram hatch (`RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_BLOCK_RAW_PR_MERGE`)
  - Fail-closed: unbalanced quotes and malformed event both block
