"""Tests for ci/ship/ship.sh — the post-merge worktree cleanup.

Focus: the exit-128 regression where TWO worktrees checked out the same branch and the
script concatenated both paths into one `git worktree remove`. ship.sh must:
  • collect ALL worktrees for the branch and remove each (not crash on the second);
  • report the merge as done even when cleanup hits a problem, never masking a
    successful squash-merge behind a non-zero exit.

Hermetic: a real temp git repo with two worktrees on one branch + a fake `gh` on PATH
(so no network / real PR). ship.sh's own merge step is the fake `gh pr merge` (a no-op);
the worktree/branch cleanup runs for real against the temp repo.

Requires bash + git. Run from the repo root::

# monkeypatched to a fake home — this is the only way to exercise a controllable tg-ctl through a

# lib). The ship.sh<->helper WIRING (proceed on exit 0, refuse otherwise, fail-closed when the
# helper is unreachable) is tested via the subprocess with a fake helper, so no real tg-ctl is
