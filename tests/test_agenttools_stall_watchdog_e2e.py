"""End-to-end proof that ``agenttools-stall-watchdog watch`` fires under a REAL stall.

Ticket: https://github.com/alex-mextner/agent-tools/issues/209

Why this file exists (separate from ``test_agenttools_stall_watchdog.py``): every test in
that suite drives either ``Watchdog`` directly with a fake clock, or ``cli.run_watch`` with
``time.time``/``time.sleep`` monkeypatched to a scripted sequence. That proves the
CLASSIFICATION logic is correct, but it never proves the thing actually fires when run for
real — a real subprocess, a real wall clock, a real ``time.sleep``, a real tmux pane. A bug
in argparse wiring, in how ``main()`` invokes ``run_watch``, or in how the tmux nudge reaches
an actual pane (as opposed to a monkeypatched ``inject``) would still pass every existing
test and still leave the watchdog silently non-functional in production.

This test launches the real ``python -m agenttools_stall_watchdog watch`` CLI as a
subprocess (no monkeypatching of time, no monkeypatching of ``Watchdog``) against a real
file, with short (2s/4s) thresholds and a real (private-socket) tmux pane as the
``--tmux-target``. It asserts:

* the WARN tier reaches the real pane as an ENGLISH nudge line (Tier-1 is agent-facing-only
  — Alex's tg#6967 correction, see ``actions.py`` module docstring), and
* the ABORT tier makes the real subprocess exit with code 2.

How a real stall is actually simulated — the non-obvious part
-------------------------------------------------------------
The naive idea "backdate the watched file's mtime into the past so the first poll is
instantly stale" does NOT work here, ON PURPOSE. ``core.Watchdog._observe`` clamps a
PRE-EXISTING old mtime up to ``started_at`` (see core.py's ``_baseline`` clamp and the
``test_preexisting_stale_file_counts_from_watchdog_start_not_old_mtime`` unit test): a
leftover log from a previous run must not make a freshly-started watch cross ``abort_after``
on poll #1 and SIGKILL a process that just started. So staleness is measured from
watchdog-START, not from the file's last write. A genuine stall is therefore simulated the
only way it happens in production: start the watch, then let real wall-clock time pass with
NO further writes to the file for longer than the (here scaled-down) thresholds. This test
does exactly that — it really sleeps inside the subprocess's poll loop.

OPT-IN / hermeticity: like the real-tmux tests in ``test_agenttools_tmux_inject.py``, these
run only when ``ASW_REAL_TMUX_TESTS`` is set (locally or a dedicated integration job), never
in the default hermetic ``pytest tests/`` gate — a real-tmux assertion is version-coupled
and would be a flaky CI signal otherwise. Also skipped when ``tmux`` isn't on PATH. The tmux
server is bound to a PRIVATE socket (``-L <socket>``) and the watchdog subprocess is pointed
at the same socket via an ``AGENTTOOLS_TMUX_BIN`` shim, so nothing ever touches the user's
real tmux server.

    Mirrors the ``live_pane`` fixture in ``test_agenttools_tmux_inject.py``: the pane runs a

    back verbatim as ``GOT[<line>]`` and delivery is verifiable via ``capture-pane`` — and,
    critically, the receiving process does NOT parse the nudge as a shell command line (a raw
    zsh/bash pane would choke on the nudge's ``[stall-watchdog]`` brackets; see ticket #210).
