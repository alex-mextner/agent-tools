"""Tests for the visual-proof-gate agent-hook (pre-bash, commit gate).

Covers the doctrine's four cases. Hook 5 has no subagent exemption; the third case is the
SATISFIED-MARKER path (a fresh "looked at a screenshot" marker => allow). So:
  BLOCK   — a commit with staged user-visible files and no fresh marker.
  ALLOW   — a commit with NO user-visible files staged (nothing to prove).
  MARKER  — staged visual files but a fresh proof marker => allow.
  ESCAPE  — env+reason and inline sentinel allow; reasonless still blocks.

Hermetic: a real tiny git repo is created in tmp_path so the hook's own `git diff --cached
--name-only` subprocess runs for real (no monkeypatching the lister); the proof-marker dir is
redirected into tmp_path. The `git diff` fail-OPEN path is also tested with a non-repo cwd.

Run from the repo root::
