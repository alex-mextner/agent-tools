# ship — green-CI-gated PR merge with pre-merge safety checks, then branch/worktree cleanup.
#
# A portable generalization of a "gh ship <PR>" helper: before merging it verifies the PR is
# actually ready, then squash-merges and cleans up. It refuses to merge when any of these is
# true (each a real way a bad merge sneaks in):
#   • PR is not OPEN / is CONFLICTING / is BEHIND its base (ruleset wants up-to-date).
#   • Required status checks aren't all passing (green-CI gate).
#   • There are unresolved review threads (see ci/review-threads/).
#   • The PR is younger than the review-dwell window (async review hasn't had time to form
#     its questions yet — "0 unresolved threads" is vacuous if no review has posted).
#   • The PR has ZERO GitHub-side reviews (`gh pr view --json reviews` is empty) — Guard-B and
#     "0 unresolved threads" are both vacuous when nobody reviewed at all (real incident: PR
#     #764/HYP-1380 merged this way). Deny-by-default, no self-service override — see the
#     external-review gate below (mirrors the review-quorum/--skip-ci hatch pattern).
#   • A UI-touching PR has no embedded screenshot (see ci/screenshots/) — unless overridden.
#   • The local branch has unpushed/diverged commits, or its worktree is dirty.
#   • The review-quorum bar (Guard-B of the self-merge-authority program) is not met: the
#     PR's task code has fewer than SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM_MIN_ITER PASSED review-cli iterations,
#     across SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM_MIN_ROLES distinct BOARD ROLES among those passed iterations —
#     role-based coverage is the PRIMARY/default check now (matching review-cli's own default,
#     review-cli#246). An explicit SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM_MIN_MODELS additionally requires that many
#     distinct MODELS too (AND logic — both floors must be met); there is no default model floor
#     any more. A failed/degraded review never counts toward either floor. There is NO
#     self-service override — a one-time bypass goes through a live Telegram approval to Alex
#     (see the hatch escalation below), never a reason flag.
#
# After a successful merge, IF a `task` (task-cli) binary is on PATH and a ticket code can be
# derived from the branch/PR title/PR body, ship calls `task mark-shipped <code> --pr <url>
# [--commit <sha>]` so the ticket records the merge and prints its own acceptance instructions
# — this NEVER closes the ticket (only proof-backed acceptance does that) and NEVER blocks or
# fails the ship (best-effort: task-cli absent, an undetectable ticket code, or a task-cli
# error are all logged and skipped, not fatal). See "task-cli notify" below the merge step.
#
# All project-specific coupling is OPTIONAL and configured by env/flags — no issue-tracker,
# no path layout, no org is hard-coded.
#
# Requires: gh (authenticated), git. jq strongly recommended (required-checks-only gating).
# task-cli (the `task` binary) is optional — its absence only skips the post-merge ticket notify.
#
# Usage:
#   ship.sh <PR-number> [--repo <owner/repo>] [--skip-ci] [--dry-run]
#           [--no-screenshot-ok <reason>] [--resolve-addressed-threads]
#           [--screenshot <path> [desc]]...
#
# Flags:
#   --repo <owner/repo>    ship a PR that lives in a DIFFERENT repo than the current checkout:
#                          pins every gh call (view/checks/merge) to owner/repo via GH_REPO.
#                          The only way to ship into a non-CWD repo when a `cd && gh ship`
#                          is not possible. Accepts -R / --repo=… / -R=… / -R… too. When the
#                          target is not this checkout's own origin, remote-branch deletion is
#                          skipped (see the cleanup guard) so the wrong remote is never touched.
#   --skip-ci              admin-merge bypassing the green-CI gate (+ branch protection). This is
#                          DENY-BY-DEFAULT: it proceeds ONLY on a one-time live Telegram approval
#                          requested via RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_SHIP_SKIP_CI (see NOTE below). It is NOT
#                          the way to handle a billing-blocked / stuck CI — for that, run ship
#                          WITHOUT --skip-ci: the normal path auto-detects the outage, runs the
#                          local fallback gate, and does a normal (non-admin) merge.
#   --dry-run              print what would happen; change nothing.
#   --no-screenshot-ok R   override the UI screenshot requirement with a logged reason R.
#   --no-version-bump-ok R override the version-bump requirement with a logged reason R
#                          (genuine no-release ship: docs-only, pure test/CI, a revert).
#   --no-review-dwell-ok R override the review-dwell window with a logged reason R (a genuine
#                          fast-track: a trivial/urgent merge that doesn't need review latency).
#   --resolve-addressed-threads  before the unresolved-threads gate, auto-close review threads that
#                          are SAFE without a human: unresolved + isOutdated + authored entirely by
#                          bots, with no P0/P1/critical/blocker/security marker in any comment
#                          (#285). NOTE: isOutdated only means the anchored code CHANGED since the
#                          comment, not that the finding was fixed. Human, high-severity,
#                          unreadable-body, or still-current threads are never touched and still
#                          block. Also SHIP_RESOLVE_ADDRESSED_THREADS=1. A bot thread with >100
#                          comments is fail-closed (never auto-resolved).
#   --rewrite-magic-close  when the magic-close gate finds a Closes/Fixes/Resolves keyword
#                          targeting an issue/ticket in the PR title or body, rewrite the keyword
#                          to "Refs" via `gh pr edit` (audited) and continue, instead of refusing.
#                          Under --dry-run the edit is only printed.
#   --screenshot P [D]     attach a local screenshot P (desc D) via SHIP_IMAGE_UPLOAD_CMD,
#                          then post it as a PR comment. Repeatable.
#   --known-flake NAME     assert that the FAILED check named NAME (as printed by the green-CI
#                          gate's own "x <name> -> <conclusion>" refusal lines) is a pre-existing
#                          failure unrelated to this diff — a confirmed CI flake, not the "CI is
#                          structurally down" case ci_appears_structurally_down() already covers
#                          (that one needs ~80% of ALL checks failing; this is for the common
#                          shape where ONE check is flaky and everything else is green). NOT a
#                          blind trust-me flag: ship independently VERIFIES the assertion before
#                          it does anything — it queries the last SHIP_FLAKE_LOOKBACK_RUNS
#                          completed runs of the SAME workflow on the PR's BASE branch and
#                          requires that this exact check name also FAILED on at least one of
#                          them (see _known_flake_confirmed). An assertion that cannot be
#                          verified this way is REFUSED, same as not passing the flag at all — so
#                          this closes, rather than reopens, the exact escalate-to-Alex-for-a-
#                          confirmed-unrelated-flake gap this flag exists to remove (see the
#                          AGENTS.md "CI billing-block" note in the repos that document it).
#                          Repeatable — every check currently FAILED in the rollup must be
#                          covered by a verified --known-flake or the gate still hard-refuses
#                          (an unaccounted-for failure is never silently waved through). On
#                          success this runs the SAME local fallback gate as the CI-down path
#                          (run_local_ci_gate) and merges only if it passes — a known flake still
#                          gets a real local verification pass, it does not skip testing
#                          entirely. Logged to SHIP_AUDIT_FILE like every other gate decision.
#
# NOTE: the review-quorum gate (Guard-B) has NO override FLAG. When its bar is not met and you
# genuinely need to proceed, request a one-time bypass by setting the env var
#   RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM="<justification>"
# which asks Alex live on Telegram (via the shared agenttools_hatch_escalation lib) and proceeds
# ONLY on his real-time approval. SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM=0 disables the whole gate (ops off-switch).
#
# NOTE: --skip-ci has NO override flag either and is deny-by-default. Request a one-time bypass by
# setting RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_SHIP_SKIP_CI="<justification>" (same shared hatch lib, same live
# Telegram approval). Unlike the review-quorum gate there is NO ops off-switch env var — an
# agent-settable off-switch would defeat the whole point; the intended path is a live approval.
# (Threat-model caveat, same as the review-quorum gate: a shipper who fully controls the ship
# PROCESS's PATH can defeat ANY gate — fake gh/git/python3 — so this removes the fail-OPEN
# asymmetry for a benign shipper, it is not a claim to withstand a hostile PATH.)
#
# Knobs (env):
#   SHIP_MAIN_CHECKOUT     path to the primary (main) checkout for the post-merge pull.
#                          Default: first worktree in `git worktree list`.
#   SHIP_DEFAULT_BRANCH    base branch name (default: main).
#   SHIP_UI_PATH_REGEX     ERE; changed files matching it => "UI-touching" (screenshot
#                          required). Default covers common front-end paths. Empty = never
#                          treat as UI (disables the screenshot gate).
#   SHIP_MERGE_METHOD      squash | merge | rebase (default: squash).
#   SHIP_IMAGE_UPLOAD_CMD  optional command to upload a screenshot and PRINT a public URL on
#                          stdout. Receives the image path as {FILE} (or as $1 if no token).
#                          Used only with --screenshot. If unset, --screenshot embeds a
#                          local-path note instead (does NOT satisfy the screenshot gate).
#   SHIP_SKIP_VERSION_BUMP=1  override the version-bump gate (same effect as
#                          --no-version-bump-ok, with a generic env-set reason). Use only for a
#                          genuine no-release ship.
#   SHIP_VERSION_FILES     space-separated list of version files to check (relative to the repo
#                          root). Default: auto-detect pyproject.toml then package.json at the
#                          root. Set it for a non-standard layout (e.g. a nested package).
#   SHIP_REVIEW_DWELL      minimum seconds since the PR's last code push before a merge is
#                          allowed, so asynchronous review (multi-model / CI-AI / human) has
#                          time to FORM its comments. Default 600 (10 min). 0 disables the gate.
#   REVIEW_TASK_CODE       the task/ticket code (e.g. HYP-931) this ship belongs to, for the
#                          review-quorum gate. If unset, ship derives it from a ticket-like
#                          token in the branch name, then the PR body: HYP-<n> / PROJ-<n> (also
#                          inside a Linear URL, https://linear.app/<team>/issue/HYP-1440/…), a
#                          descriptive ALL-CAPS code, a keyword-anchored `Refs #<n>`, or a full
#                          issue URL of THIS repo (https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<n>
#                          — the shape task-cli's links gate demands; both yield the literal
#                          `#<n>`). If none is found, the gate refuses (fail-closed) with guidance.
#   SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM_ENABLED / SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM  set either to 0 to disable the
#                          review-quorum gate entirely (default: enabled).
#   SHIP_TASK_NOTIFY_ENABLED  set to 0/false/no to disable the post-merge task-cli notify step
#                          (default: enabled). Best-effort and never blocks the merge either
#                          way — this only controls whether `task mark-shipped` gets called at
#                          all. See "task-cli notify" below the merge step for the full story.
#   SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM_MIN_ITER    quorum floor: PASSED review-cli iterations (default 3). CLAMPED
#                          to a hard minimum of 3 — raise-only, an unset/0/negative/below-3 value
#                          resolves to 3 (fail-closed #242).
#   SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM_MIN_ROLES   quorum floor: distinct BOARD ROLES among the passed iterations
#                          (default 3). Same >=3 clamp. This is now the PRIMARY/default gate
#                          mechanism and is ALWAYS enforced, matching review-cli's own default
#                          (review-cli#246).
#   SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM_MIN_MODELS  quorum floor: distinct models (default 3). Same >=3 clamp.
#                          Enforced ONLY when this env var is explicitly set by the operator —
#                          there is no default model floor any more (role-based coverage is the
#                          default). When set, ship also passes --min-models to review-cli, so
#                          BOTH floors are required (mirrors review-cli's own explicit-vs-default
#                          AND logic, review-cli#246).
#   RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM  one-time bypass request for the review-quorum gate:
#                          set it to a written justification to ask Alex live on Telegram (via
#                          the shared agenttools_hatch_escalation lib); the gate proceeds ONLY on
#                          his real-time approval. Blank/bare-flag values are denied; unset means
#                          no bypass requested (the gate refuses with guidance). tg-ctl is
#                          resolved by the shared lib from a rig.yaml agent_hooks.tg_ctl_path in
#                          the OS account's REAL home (pwd.getpwuid — NOT the $HOME env var, NOT
#                          the PR's repo), then a trusted-paths allowlist. Neither the lib dir nor
#                          tg-ctl is env- or repo-overridable, so nothing the shipper/PR controls
#                          can redirect approval to a stub.
#   SHIP_EXTERNAL_REVIEW_ENABLED / SHIP_EXTERNAL_REVIEW  set either to 0 to disable the
#                          external-review gate entirely (default: enabled). This gate refuses a
#                          merge when `gh pr view --json reviews` is empty — see that gate below.
#   RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_SHIP_EXTERNAL_REVIEW  one-time bypass request for the external-review
#                          gate, same shape/hardening as RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM
#                          above — see ci/ship/external_review_hatch.py.
#   SHIP_ACCEPTANCE_GATE   set to 0/false/no to disable the pre-merge ACCEPTANCE gate (default:
#                          enabled) — the gate that runs `task gate <code> --json` (task-cli) and
#                          refuses the merge while the ticket has unchecked criteria or checks
#                          without a proof. Also settable as a committed `.ship-config` line
#                          (see "Knobs (file)"). Ops off-switch; the per-ticket opt-out is
#                          `task change <code> --post-merge-acceptance "<reason>"`, recorded ON
#                          the ticket and reported in the audit line. See "acceptance gate" below.
#   SHIP_MAGIC_CLOSE_GATE  set to 0/false/no to disable the magic-close keyword gate (default:
#                          enabled) — refuses a PR whose title/body carries close/closes/closed/
#                          fix/fixes/fixed/resolve/resolves/resolved followed by #N, owner/repo#N
#                          or a ticket code (ABC-123), because GitHub and Linear close the ticket
#                          on merge behind task-cli's gates. See "magic-close keyword gate" below.
#   SHIP_AUDIT_FILE        path for the gate audit JSONL (default
#                          ~/.config/agent-tools/ship-audit.jsonl). One line is appended per
#                          non-dry-run gated ship. review-quorum gate decisions: authorized /
#                          bypass:approved / bypass:denied / refused (has a `task_code` field).
#                          --skip-ci gate decisions: skipci:bypass:approved / skipci:bypass:denied
#                          / skipci:refused (has a `gate":"skip-ci"` field). external-review gate
#                          decisions: external-review:bypass:approved / :bypass:denied /

#                          decisions: authorized / authorized:post-merge-opt-out / refused /
#                          skipped / auto-closed / auto-close-failed (has `gate":"acceptance"`, a
#                          `task_code` when one was derived, and a `detail` — the opt-out reason,
#                          the open criteria, or why it was skipped; auto-closed/auto-close-failed
#                          are the post-merge `task done <code>` this gate also runs when every
#                          criterion was already proven pre-merge — see ci/ship/README.md's
#                          "Auto-close" section). magic-close gate decisions: refused / rewritten
#                          (has `gate":"magic-close"` and the matched phrases in `detail`).
#                          --dry-run prints the would-be audit instead of writing.
#
# Knobs (file):
#   .ship-config           optional, committed at the repo root — an AUDITED, per-repo override
#                          for the CI-down local test fallback gate (see "CI-down detection and
#                          local fallback gate" below). Unlike SHIP_LOCAL_TEST_CMD (an env var,
#                          test-only, never meant for production use — see that knob above),
#                          this file is checked into the repo itself, so it is reviewed exactly
#                          like rig.yaml/package.json already are — it does NOT introduce a new
#                          trust boundary, it is a production-safe, auditable way to tell the
#                          local gate where and how to run tests when auto-detection can't guess
#                          correctly (e.g. a monorepo-of-fixtures whose real suite lives in a
#                          subdirectory). The file is read from the last COMMITTED content at
#                          HEAD (`git show HEAD:.ship-config`), never the working tree — an
#                          uncommitted/staged-only .ship-config is ignored with a warning —
#                          the "audited, committed" claim above is an enforced property, not
#                          just documentation. Simple `KEY=value` lines, no quote-stripping
#                          (don't wrap values in quotes — `KEY="val"` means the literal value
#                          `"val"`, not `val`); `#`-only-prefixed lines and blank lines are

# --- core.bare corruption guard --------------------------------------------------------
# A WORKING checkout whose `git config core.bare` is wrongly `true` is a real corruption
# class (external cause — see rig-cli #19/#52, where `rig doctor --fix` repairs it). It
# breaks EVERY git op in that directory (status / diff / commit / worktree all fail fatal
# with "this operation must be run in a work tree"), so ship's later main-refresh /
# worktree ops would fail CONFUSINGLY mid-ship (it bit a real ship this session). We catch
# it EARLY — before any destructive git op on the checkout — and ABORT (exit 1, ship's
# uniform "Refusing:" preflight code) with the repo + the one-line fix, rather than auto-fix
# (ship must never silently rewrite repo config).
#
# Detection keys off git's per-path `rev-parse --is-bare-repository` verdict (NOT a raw
# `core.bare` config read, NOT `worktree list`'s bare marker): both of those read `true` for a
# LEGITIMATE linked worktree of a genuine bare repo (shared config), whereas rev-parse correctly
# reports such a worktree as not-bare — at the worktree root AND from any subdirectory of it.
# That single property is the false-positive shield, so the two entry points below differ only
# in WHERE they look, not in the test:
#   • abort_if_core_bare DIR — used for an explicit checkout/worktree PATH (the main checkout,
#     each linked worktree). It also requires the WORKING-checkout layout (`.git` at DIR's root)
#     so a genuine bare repo dir (`foo.git`, no `.git` entry, rev-parse=true) is excluded.
#   • abort_if_cwd_core_bare — used for the AMBIENT cwd, which may be a SUBDIRECTORY of the
#     corrupt checkout (the realistic "ship launched from inside it" shape). `.git` lives only
#     at the worktree root, so the DIR layout gate above would wrongly pass a subdir. We can't
#     drop the genuine-bare exclusion entirely, though: a GENUINE bare repo (`foo.git`) — or any
#     subdir inside one — also reports rev-parse=bare, but there `core.bare=true` is LEGITIMATE,
#     so firing the "corruption" diagnostic (and worse, telling the user to run `config core.bare
#     false`, which would BREAK a real bare repo) is actively wrong. The clean discriminator,
#     evaluable from a subdir, is `rev-parse --is-inside-git-dir`: it is FALSE in a corrupt
#     working checkout (cwd is a work tree) but TRUE inside a genuine bare repo (the bare dir IS
#     the git dir). We also require a `.git` entry somewhere in the cwd's ancestry (present for a
#     working checkout, absent for a bare repo) as belt-and-suspenders.
# $3 is the exact fix command to print. It MUST match where core.bare actually lives: a plain
# `git config core.bare false` writes the SHARED config, but a WORKTREE-SCOPED core.bare=true
# (extensions.worktreeConfig + `config --worktree core.bare true`) keeps winning over a shared
# `false`, so for that case the fix must be `config --worktree core.bare false`. Callers compute
# the right command (see core_bare_fix_cmd) so the printed advice actually repairs the repo.

# A --repo invocation is "foreign" when it names a repo we cannot positively confirm is this
# checkout's own origin: either it differs from the derived origin, or that origin is unknown
# (a local/non-github remote — the case in the test harness). In cleanup, `git push origin
# --delete <branch>` targets THIS checkout's origin, not --repo's remote, so deleting there
# would hit the wrong repo (or a same-named branch in it). We therefore skip remote-branch
# deletion for a foreign invocation and let GitHub's auto-delete-head-branch (or a manual
# delete) handle the target repo. This is complementary to the fork-PR CROSS_REPO check
# below (which covers a PR from a fork of the SAME repo); both independently skip deletion.
#
# SCOPE (inherited from the pre-thin-delegator ship script this ports): only the gh calls
# (view / checks / merge) and the REMOTE-branch delete are made target-aware. The remaining
# LOCAL operations — the version-bump gate's version-file lookup ($ROOT), the CI-down local
# test runner ($ROOT), and the local worktree/branch preflight + cleanup ($BRANCH) — stay
# bound to the CWD checkout, exactly as the original documented ("cross-repo cleanup requires
# the PR's branch to exist locally"). In practice a foreign PR's branch name rarely collides
# with a local branch here, so this is a soft limitation, not a regression. Making those paths
# fully target-aware needs a target-checkout mapping and is tracked as a follow-up (see the PR
# / issue) rather than folded into this minimal restoration.
# Foreign-ness is derived from the EFFECTIVE gh target, not `REPO_FLAG` alone. `gh` honours
# THREE ways to name a target repo — `--repo`, and the `GH_SHIP_REPO`/`GH_REPO` environment
# vars — any of which points every gh call (view/merge) at another repo. If foreign-ness saw
# only `REPO_FLAG`, a target named via either env var would leave `_FOREIGN_REPO_INVOKE=0` and
# slip past every guard that keys on it (remote-branch delete, local cleanup, AND the
# empty-rollup local-gate path), running the local gate against the AMBIENT checkout and
# merging the wrong repo. So fold all three in (precedence matches how GH_REPO is set above:
# --repo, else GH_SHIP_REPO, else a pre-existing ambient GH_REPO). A target equal to this
# checkout's own origin is NOT foreign. (Residual: the compare is a raw string, so the same
# origin written in a different form — a `.git` suffix, a URL, a case change — reads as foreign
# and conservatively skips cleanup; that errs toward not touching the wrong repo.)

# --- CI-down detection and local fallback gate -----------------------------------------
# When ALL (or ≥ 80%) CI checks fail and the failure pattern matches a structural outage
# (GitHub Actions down, billing suspended, runner quota exhausted) rather than real test
# failures, blocking the merge is unhelpful. The signals: all/most checks fail + either
# the GitHub status page shows Actions degradation OR the checks completed suspiciously
# fast (< 30s — faster than any real test suite can run). When both signals agree, the
# local gate runs instead: local tests + leftover-marker scan + PR checklist + threads.
# If local gates pass → merge. If they fail or detection is ambiguous → block normally.
#
# Knobs (env):
#   SHIP_CI_STATUS_URL   URL for the GitHub status components API (default: githubstatus.com).
#                        Override in tests to point at a local fake.
#   SHIP_TEST_CI_DOWN    Set to "1" to force-trigger the CI-down path (test-only shortcut,
#                        bypasses the detection heuristics). Never set in production.
#   SHIP_LOCAL_TEST_CMD  Override the local test command (test-only; default: auto-detect).
#
# Local test auto-detection order (see _local_test_runner): SHIP_LOCAL_TEST_CMD env var (if
# set) > $root/.ship-config file (see "Knobs (file)" above) > rig.yaml + `dev` CLI (root-only)
# > root-level pyproject.toml/package.json/Cargo.toml > the same three manifests in e2e/ ONLY,
# one level down (bounded — no deeper recursion, no arbitrary directory scan, and deliberately
# NOT test/tests/ — see the priority-5 comment in _local_test_runner) > fail closed with
# "no recognized test runner found". The config file
# outranks rig.yaml deliberately: it exists precisely to override a heuristic that guessed
# wrong, so it must win over the OTHER heuristic (rig.yaml/dev) too, not just auto-detect.
# Residual caveat (same trust boundary as rig.yaml/package.json, not a new one — see
# _ship_config_load below): a PR can add/edit .ship-config in the same commit that needs
# verifying, same as it could already add a stub `"test": "true"` script to package.json —
# this file does not change what a malicious PR could already get away with, review still
# has to look at test-affecting changes either way.

# --- known-flake gate (--known-flake NAME) --------------------------------------------
# A NARROWER sibling of the CI-down path above: ci_appears_structurally_down() only fires when
# ~80% of ALL checks fail (a whole-infrastructure outage). The far more common real shape is
# "one specific check is a flaky, already-broken-on-main test and every other check is green" —
# that does not look like an outage at all, so the CI-down path never triggers for it, and
# without this gate the only way through was a human escalation for something a quick check of
# the base branch's own recent CI history already answers (this repeated, avoidable escalation
# is exactly what this gate exists to close — see AGENTS.md's "CI billing-block" note in repos
# that document that history).
#
# $1 = check NAME as it appears in the rollup (.name // .context — the same string the green-CI
# gate's own refusal already prints). $2 = that check's workflowName (may be empty for a
# StatusContext, which has none), used to scope the base-branch lookup to the SAME workflow so a
# same-named check from an unrelated workflow can't manufacture a false match. $3 = the PR's
# ACTUAL base branch (baseRefName), resolved ONCE by the caller (see the call site) — NOT
# re-derived per check. Two reasons this is a required argument, not an internal lookup: (a) a
# `gh pr view` failure inside a per-check helper is easy to silently paper over with a
# same-shaped fallback (a real prior version of this function did exactly that — see the caller
# for why that direction is wrong for THIS gate specifically), and (b) it avoids re-querying the
# identical answer once per failing check.
#
# Evidence, not trust: queries the last SHIP_FLAKE_LOOKBACK_RUNS (default 5) COMPLETED runs of
# that workflow on $3 and requires a job of the SAME name to have FAILED in at least one of
# them. A flake does not have to fail every run — that is what makes it a flake rather than a
# hard break — so ANY match in the window is sufficient; the absence of any match is what
# refuses the claim. Fail-closed throughout: a gh/jq read failure, an empty run list, or no
# matching failure anywhere in the window all return 1 (NOT confirmed) — the caller then treats
# the check as a genuine, blocking failure exactly as if --known-flake had never been passed
# for it.
#
# Scope, stated plainly: this confirms "this check NAME has also failed recently on the base
# branch, independent of this PR" — job-name granularity, not a guarantee that the SAME
# sub-test/assertion failed both times (a job that bundles a large suite, like this repo's own
# monorepo-wide "Tests" check, could in principle fail for two DIFFERENT reasons on two
# different runs and still match here). That is a real, accepted limitation, not an oversight —
# a shipper should still glance at the failure output before asserting the flag (the refusal
# message this gate's caller prints tells them exactly what failed), and the base-branch match
# is logged to SHIP_AUDIT_FILE precisely so an asserted-but-wrong claim is reviewable after the
# fact, same as the review-quorum and skip-ci gates already are.

# Scan the PR diff additions for leftover markers: an unfinished-work marker
# ("[T]ODO"/"[F]IXME"/"[H]ACK") or a standalone "[X]XX" marker.
# Returns 0 if clean, 1 if markers found or diff cannot be read.
#
# Bracket-expression trick on the FIRST letter of each marker (`[T]ODO` instead of
# spelling it bare): functionally IDENTICAL to the plain literal in an ERE — a
# single-character bracket class matches exactly that one character, same as writing
# it bare — but it means this file's own source (this line, and every comment/fixture
# that needs to spell an example) never contains any marker as ONE contiguous token.
# This is the standard "grep must not match its own pattern" idiom (the same trick as
# `ps aux | grep '[f]oo'` to exclude the grep process itself from its own output).
#
# Why this matters here specifically: this exact regex line, its own explanatory
# comments, and the fixtures in tests/test_ship.py that exercise it ALL legitimately
# need to spell these marker strings as literal example/test data. Without the
# bracket-expression split, ANY PR editing this gate's own implementation or tests
# would self-trigger the CI-outage fallback, regardless of whether it added a REAL
# leftover marker (agent-tools#318, found reviewing #317).
#
# Two designs were tried and rejected before this one (both add an exemption
# mechanism instead of removing the self-match at the source):
#   - An inline sentinel comment marking "ignore from here to here" inside the diff
#     content itself — rejected: the diff being scanned IS the untrusted PR content,
#     so an unclosed or duplicated sentinel written by the PR author would silently
#     blind the scanner to every file after it in the whole diff.
#   - A file-path exemption (skip any hunk whose diff header names this file or its
#     test file) — works and has no injection surface if hunk-boundary-aware, but
#     blanket-exempts ALL additions to those 2 files from this LOCAL FALLBACK gate,
#     opening a blind window exactly where a motivated author would most want it
#     closed: CI down + editing the gate itself + a genuine forgotten marker.
# The bracket-expression split has neither downside: no new mechanism, no exemption,
# no blind window — this file's own source simply never contains a literal match, so
# there's nothing to exempt. Unlike the file-path-exemption design, it needs no
# coordination with the CI-up ci/leftover-grep/leftover-grep.sh gate to stay
# consistent: this scanner just doesn't have a self-reference problem to solve.
# (leftover-grep.sh's OWN detector line has the identical literal-marker self-match
# exposure for a PR that edits leftover-grep.sh itself — not fixed here, since it's a
# separate file/gate outside agent-tools#318's scope; tracked as agent-tools#330. A
# related pre-existing diff-header-parsing false negative in both gates — a real
# added line that itself starts with "++" collides with the diff's own "+++ b/path"
# header prefix — is tracked as agent-tools#329.)
#
# The [X]XX marker alone gets an additional run-length guard —
# `(^|[^X])[X]XX($|[^X])`, a portable "no word-boundary regex, no grep -w" idiom in
# the same style this repo already uses in ci/leftover-grep/leftover-grep.sh's
# focused-test check — because a plain substring match collides with bash's
# conventional mktemp template suffix (`mktemp -d "/tmp/foo.XXXXXX"`), a common and
# legitimate pattern (agent-tools#316). This only excludes a marker inside a longer
# run of X's (4+), so it deliberately still catches one embedded in an identifier,
# e.g. an [X]XX-prefixed sentinel like `[X]XX_REMOVE_BEFORE_MERGE` or
# `foo[X]XX_debug()` — unlike a full word-boundary fix, which would also let those
# slip through (checked against neighboring X vs non-X only, not against "is this a
# word character"). Residual limitation, accepted as-is: a 3-character mktemp
# template (`foo.[X]XX`) is indistinguishable from a real standalone marker and still
# blocks; this is rare/weak enough (bash's own docs recommend 6+ X's) not to warrant
# a smarter check.
#
# The other three markers deliberately keep plain substring matching (unlike [X]XX).
# For [T]ODO/[F]IXME this local fallback gate must stay at least as strict as
# ci/leftover-grep/leftover-grep.sh's untracked-marker check (that gate greps for
# `[T]ODO|[F]IXME`, also substring, so it catches sentinel identifiers like
# `[T]ODO_REMOVE_BEFORE_MERGE`): loosening these two to whole-word would let such
# genuine leftovers slip through the CI-outage fallback while the normal CI-up gate
# still catches them — a fail-open divergence between the two gates. [H]ACK has no
# such parity requirement — ci/leftover-grep/leftover-grep.sh does NOT check for it at
# all, so this fallback gate is deliberately STRICTER than the CI-up gate on [H]ACK,
# not matched to it (a PR-time [H]ACK passes normal CI but blocks under this
# CI-outage-only fallback; accepted, since a stricter fallback is a safe direction to
# diverge in). There's no known real-world false positive for these three that would
# justify loosening any of them (mktemp templates are an [X]XX-specific nuisance; a
# project name or filename that happens to contain one of these four
# letter-sequences as a substring is a much rarer nuisance than a missed marker).

# --- auto-resolve addressed bot-nit review threads (opt-in; #268) -----------------------

# threads that are SAFE to resolve without a human: unresolved AND isOutdated (the code the thread
# anchored to has changed) AND authored ENTIRELY by automated reviewers, with no P0/P1/critical/
# blocker/security marker in any comment (#285). A thread with ANY human comment, high-severity
# marker, unreadable body, or one still current is NEVER touched — it falls through and still blocks
# the merge. This lets a shipping agent close its own bot nits through
# `gh ship` instead of hand-running the resolveReviewThread mutation the block-raw-pr-merge hook used
# to false-block (#268). ship runs these gh calls as a child process, so the agent-hook never sees
# them; the hook fix is for an agent resolving threads directly. It runs during preflight, so if a
# LATER gate (CI-green, review-dwell, version-bump, quorum, clean-worktree) then refuses, some
# eligible bot nits may already be resolved on a PR that does not merge this run — accepted, because
# those nits are genuinely addressed and would need resolving next run anyway.

# mutable state like `pull_request.body`, e.g. the "PR Checklist" gate that fails while an
# acceptance box is unchecked, then passes once it is ticked), the rollup holds BOTH the old
# FAILURE and the new SUCCESS for the same check name. Counting every entry made this gate
# refuse a PR that GitHub itself reports mergeStateStatus=CLEAN (observed live on PR #653,
# 2026-07-12). Fix: collapse the rollup to the LATEST run per check (grouped by
# __typename + workflowName + name / context, keyed on completedAt/startedAt/createdAt) BEFORE
# evaluating pass/pending/fail — matching how GitHub computes mergeStateStatus. Fail-closed is
# preserved: if the LATEST run of a check is FAILURE/CANCELLED/pending, that latest verdict
# still gates. __typename is in the key so a StatusContext and a CheckRun that happen to share
# a name (a CheckRun can have a null workflowName) are NOT collapsed into one — collapsing them
# could hide a still-failing check behind a newer passing one of the other type.

# ALREADY EXIST. "0 unresolved threads" is ALSO true when no review has POSTED yet — so a PR
# opened and shipped within seconds passes that gate vacuously, before any multi-model / CI-AI /
# human review could form its questions. This gate enforces a minimum DWELL window since the PR's
# last code push, so a review has time to land; whatever it then posts becomes a thread the gate
# above forces resolved. Together they mean: comments get TIME to form AND must be resolved.
#
# Runs INDEPENDENTLY of --skip-ci: a premature merge is premature regardless of CI billing.
#
# The window starts at max(createdAt, pushedDate, committedDate, forcePushedAt):
#   • createdAt — the floor; a reviewer can't review before the PR exists, so even a PR built
#     from an old commit waits from PR-open.
#   • pushedDate — GitHub-CONTROLLED head-update time (when GitHub received the push). Reliable
#     for normal pushes but can be null (deprecated on the Commit object) and stale on force-pushes
#     to an already-on-GitHub commit.
#   • committedDate — the embedded commit date. Reliable fallback for pushedDate==null on the common
#     commit→push / rebase→push path.
#   • forcePushedAt — HeadRefForcePushedEvent.createdAt (last event); the authoritative signal
#     that the PR head was force-pushed to an old commit where pushedDate would be stale.

# --- version-bump gate: a release of shippable source MUST bump the declared version ----
# Rationale (skill: bump-version-on-release): a tool's version is a freshness signal — it
# tells a user which build they run and whether a fix landed. That only works if the
# declared version is bumped on EVERY release. The canonical failure is a version that never
# moves across many ships (e.g. a permanently-stale `0.1.0`), turning `--version` into noise.
# So: if this PR changes shippable SOURCE (not docs / not tests / not CI) and the repo's
# declared version field is UNCHANGED vs the PR base, refuse — this ship is a release and the
# version must move. Override for a genuine no-release ship via --no-version-bump-ok <reason>
# or SHIP_SKIP_VERSION_BUMP=1.
#
# Repo-agnostic: detection works off the PR's own changed files + diff (no tracker / layout /
# org hard-coded). A changed path is "shippable source" UNLESS it matches the docs/test/CI
# exclusion set below; the version file is auto-located (pyproject.toml `version =`, then
# package.json `"version"`) or pinned via SHIP_VERSION_FILES.

# A path is NON-shippable (does NOT, on its own, make a ship a release) iff it is docs, a
# test, or CI/meta. Everything else is treated as shippable source. Kept deliberately broad
# on the exclusion side so a docs-only / test-only / CI-only PR is never forced to bump.

# --- screenshot gate (optional uploader + UI-touching check) ---------------------------
# Compose the SHIP_IMAGE_UPLOAD_CMD template with `replacement` spliced in wherever `{FILE}`
# appears — bare (`{FILE}`) or wrapped in its OWN dedicated matching quotes (`"{FILE}"` /
# `'{FILE}'`, replaced WHOLE, quotes included: the caller's `replacement` already supplies its
# own quoting via `%q`, so nesting it inside the operator's quotes would corrupt it — see
# upload_png). A SINGLE left-to-right pass over the ORIGINAL `haystack` finds, at each point,
# whichever of the three forms starts EARLIEST (ties broken toward the quoted forms, since a
# bare `{FILE}` match is always a substring of a quoted one at the same position — `%%pat*`'s
# "not found" case is used AS its own sentinel: an unmatched candidate's prefix equals the
# full remaining haystack length, which is never shorter than a real match's prefix, so it
# can never incorrectly win). Never rescans `out`/`replacement` for a later pass to find
# another `{FILE}` in already-emitted text — REQUIRED, not cosmetic: `replacement` is a %q
# escaped path, and `%q` does not escape `{`/`}`, so a screenshot path containing the literal
# substring `{FILE}` would otherwise get corrupted by a later pass re-matching text this same
# call already emitted (regression pinned in tests). `%%"$needle"*` / `#*"$needle"` are
# pattern-REMOVAL operators (needle is quoted = literal, no glob), not `${var//pat/rep}`

# --- review-quorum preflight gate (Guard-B, self-merge-authority program) --------------
# WHY this exists: the earlier gates verify CI is green and human/AI review THREADS are
# resolved, but neither proves an actual multi-model review RAN. This gate is the "strictly
# controlled" guarantee — it hard-refuses the merge unless review-cli's own record shows the
# PR's task code has enough PASSED review iterations across enough distinct models among those
# passed iterations (only clean-verdict runs count — a review that ran but failed/degraded, and
# pre-verdict-field history, never satisfy the bar; see `review task --help`). Fail-CLOSED: a
# missing `review` CLI, an unreadable store, no derivable task code, OR a quorum reading 0
# iterations / 0 distinct models all refuse rather than merge unverified — ship re-derives the
# verdict from the counts and never trusts the subprocess's `passed` boolean alone (#242).
#
# There is NO self-service override. When the bar is not met (or cannot be verified) and the
# agent genuinely needs to proceed, it sets RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM="<justification>";
# that routes through the shared agenttools_hatch_escalation lib (the SAME lib the
# pin-primary-worktree / block-reset-hard agent-hooks use) to ask Alex live on Telegram, and the
# gate proceeds ONLY on his real-time approval. SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM=0 disables the whole gate.
#
# Runs independently of --skip-ci, same posture as the review-dwell gate above.

# Prints EVERY ticket-like token found in $1, one per line, in ARM-PRIORITY order (then
# document order within an arm; duplicates removed), or nothing. Tries the repo's own HYP-<n>
# convention first (case-insensitive, normalized to uppercase; a Linear URL such as
# `https://linear.app/<team>/issue/HYP-1440/<slug>` carries the code in its path and is caught
# by this same arm), then a generic UPPERCASE-PREFIX-<n> ticket token (2+ uppercase letters, a
# hyphen, digits) so other repos' conventions (JIRA-style PROJ-123, etc.) are also picked up,
# then a purely descriptive review-cli task code (2+ uppercase letters, then 2-OR-MORE
# hyphen-joined 2+-letter uppercase segments -- 3+ segments total, no digits) so hand-picked
# codes like `SME-ROADMAP-WORKTREE-NOTE` or `WT-GITIGNORE-EXCLUDE` -- real task codes
# review-cli's own run-stats log records fine, just without a numeric suffix -- are also
# auto-derived (#384), then, as the last fallbacks for repos that track work as plain GitHub
# issues rather than a lettered ticket prefix, a keyword-anchored GitHub issue reference
# (`Fixes #105`, `Refs #105`) returned literal as `#105`, and finally a full issue URL of the
# PR's OWN repo (`https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/105`, also returned literal as
# `#105`; see each arm's own comment). `LC_ALL=C` on every grep here: outside
# the C locale, `[A-Z]` bracket ranges are collation-dependent (glibc's en_US.UTF-8 can interleave
# case), which would make the "uppercase-only" guarantee below hold only by luck of the ambient
# locale -- same fix idiom the `tr` calls elsewhere in this file already use.
#
# The descriptive arm is extracted in two stages: first the FULL boundary-delimited token
# (letters/digits/hyphens, stops at the first char outside that set), then an exact whole-token
# match against the letters-only shape, evaluated per CANDIDATE (not the whole text), so one
# rejected candidate never shadows a clean one appearing later. That order matters: a token with
# a stray digit buried inside a segment (`SME-ROADMAP-V2-NOTE`) is rejected outright instead of
# silently grep -o'ing a truncated prefix (`SME-ROADMAP-V`) as if it were the real code.
#
# The 3-segment floor (each segment 2+ letters) is a deliberate, documented trade-off: it rules
# out the common TWO-word hyphenated English that would otherwise false-positive on ordinary
# PR-body prose -- "READ-ONLY", "CI-CD", "PRE-COMMIT", "API-KEY", "OPT-IN" are all 2 segments and
# do NOT match. Two known, ACCEPTED residuals remain, same class of imprecision the numeric
# pattern above already tolerates for stray "AB-12"-shaped text, and both fail CLOSED regardless
# -- review-cli has no record for a wrongly-derived code, so ship still refuses, just with a less
# friendly message than "could not derive a task code" (#384 review notes):
#   - a rarer three-word phrase ("END-TO-END", "DO-NOT-MERGE") can still slip through uncaught;
#   - a digit fused directly onto (or hyphen-separated immediately before) the token's OWN first
#     segment ("2FA-SETUP-FLOW", "123-ABC-DEF-GHI") isn't caught by the boundary-free `[A-Z]`
#     start -- POSIX ERE has no lookbehind to assert "not preceded by a digit/letter" here;
#   - the numeric arm runs FIRST, so an incidental uppercase-acronym-plus-digit token that has
#     nothing to do with the real ticket ("UTF-8", "SHA-256", "RFC-2119", "ISO-8601" all match
#     `[A-Z][A-Z]+-[0-9]+`) is listed AHEAD of a valid descriptive code appearing later in the
#     same PR body. It no longer HIDES it (agent-tools#571): every candidate is returned, and each
#     caller filters by its own admission rule and takes the first survivor -- the review-quorum
#     gate moves on when review-cli has no record at all for a candidate, the acceptance/notify
#     derivation when task-cli's id grammar or the self-PR rule rejects it. Before #571 this
#     function returned only the first match of the first matching arm, so PR #560's incidental
#     `GH-560` (an example in its acceptance proofs, rejected as the PR's own number) hid the real
#     `Refs #541` further down the SAME body, and the acceptance gate skipped instead of judging.
#
# Rejections inside this function are the two AMBIGUITY rules (two distinct keyword-anchored
# refs, two distinct same-repo issue URLs) and the foreign-repo URL rule; each is reported on
# stderr so a "could not derive" downstream is traceable to the text that caused it.

#
# GitHub issue reference (`Fixes #105`, `Refs #105`) — for repos (like conloca-landing) that
# track work as GitHub issues rather than Linear/JIRA-style codes. Returned LITERAL, not
# normalized: task-cli's own `_route_id_to_project` (tasklib/cli.py) routes a bare GitHub id
# by checking `tid.startswith("#")` first — a `GH-<n>`-style rewrite doesn't match that check,
# falls through to the Linear-team-prefix branch instead, and `task mark-shipped` fails with
# an unroutable-id error. review-cli's own `normalize_task_code` (reviewlib/stats.py) accepts
# any non-whitespace, non-control-character token — `#105` passes it unchanged, so there is no
# downstream reason to rewrite it (the review-quorum gate looks up BOTH spellings anyway,
# agent-tools#572).
# Only a KEYWORD-ANCHORED local reference qualifies (`Closes|Fixes|Resolves|Refs|References`
# immediately before the `#<n>`, GitHub's own closing-keyword grammar plus the `Refs` form used
# when the ticket must NOT auto-close on merge). Three hazards rule out a bare `#<n>` anywhere
# in the text, all of them concrete because this same helper feeds BOTH the review-quorum
# record lookup and the post-merge `task mark-shipped` call:
#   - GitHub's qualified cross-repo syntax (`other-org/other-repo#123`, incl. repo names ending
#     in `-`/`.`) names an issue in ANOTHER repo; extracting its `#123` would mark an unrelated
#     local issue shipped. The keyword form never matches it: `#` must follow the keyword
#     directly, never a repo name.
#   - a URL fragment (`https://example.org/docs/#105`) or a Markdown anchor is not an issue.
#   - an incidental prose mention (`follow-up for #12`, `(#268)`) of an ALREADY-SHIPPED issue
#     would resolve to that issue's OLD passed quorum record, granting an unreviewed PR merge
#     authority — unlike a wrongly-derived HYP/PROJ token, a referenced GitHub issue routinely
#     HAS a record in an issue-tracked repo, so the "fail-closed anyway" reasoning above does
#     not hold here.
# This arm is listed AFTER the generic PREFIX-<n> arm AND the descriptive ALL-CAPS arm above, so
# a `Fixes #45` aside never outranks a real `PROJ-123` or `SME-ROADMAP-WORKTREE-NOTE` code in
# the same body (for a descriptive-code repo that aside would otherwise be the very borrowing
# path described above). The keyword itself must not be the TAIL of a repo path (`org/hot-fix#5`,
# `org/fix#5`, `org/my.fix#5` are all qualified refs), so the char before it may not be a
# repo-name char (`-`/`.`) or `/` either; the digits must end at a non-word boundary (`#123abc`
# is not an issue ref). Two DISTINCT anchored refs in one text (`Partially fixes #12 ... Closes
# #200`) are an ambiguous task code: every other branch of this gate is fail-closed, so nothing
# is derived from them — and the URL arm below is suppressed too (never fall through an
# ambiguity) — so ship refuses instead of silently taking the first in document order. The match
# may swallow at most ONE trailing WORD char (to reject `#123abc` below) and never the non-word
# char after the digits: `grep -o` matches don't overlap, so consuming a `,` in `closes
# #12,fixes #200` would eat the second ref's leading boundary and hide the ambiguity. Known
# limit (POSIX ERE has no lookahead): the guard sees honest ambiguity with realistic separators
# (space, `,`, `;`, `.`+space, newline); a second ref glued on by a word char (`#34xrefs #56`) or
# by a `/`/`.`/`-` (`#12/fixes #200`) keeps no admissible leading boundary and stays hidden — an
# author who can craft that could as well omit the ref, so it is not defended against.
# Trade-off, accepted: a bare `#105` with no keyword (a `fix/#105` branch name, a `#105 widget`
# title) is NOT derived either — pass $REVIEW_TASK_CODE.

# recognize and this gate refused it with "could not derive a task code"; agents then
# hand-set REVIEW_TASK_CODE, the manual step that gets forgotten. The URL yields the SAME
# literal `#<n>` the keyword arm yields, so review-cli's quorum record and task-cli's routing
# see one code regardless of body syntax. Rules, mirroring the keyword arm's hazards:
#   - the URL's owner/repo must be one of the PR's own slugs (_ship_own_repo_slugs: explicit
#     --repo, checkout origin, live PR URL; compared case-insensitively — GitHub slugs are);
#     an issue of ANOTHER repo is never this PR's
#     ticket (cross-repo companions like "tg-cli#301 <-> agent-tools#524" are routine here);
#     an unknown own-repo (no github origin, no --repo, no PR url) derives nothing.
#   - only `/issues/<n>` counts — a `/pull/<n>` link is a PR, not a ticket; `www.` and a
#     trailing `#issuecomment-…` anchor are tolerated; the digits must end at a non-word
#     boundary (`/issues/12abc` is not an issue), same as the `#123abc` rule above.
#   - two DISTINCT same-repo issue URLs are ambiguous → nothing (fail-closed); the same
#     issue linked twice is one ticket.
# No keyword anchor is required (unlike the `#<n>` arm): the links gate's own output shape is
# `Refs [#548](https://…/issues/548)`, where `[` sits between any keyword and the URL, so an
# anchor would defeat the purpose. Accepted residual: a body whose ONLY same-repo issue link
# is an incidental mention of some other, already-shipped issue derives that issue — such a

# The helper prints a verdict SENTINEL + reason on stdout ("APPROVED …" / "DENIED …") and owns the
# non-dry-run bypass:* audit line; in dry-run it writes no persistent audit and ship.sh prints the
# would-be audit preview. Its exit code: 0 approved, 1 requested-but-not-approved
# (blank/bare/denied/timeout), 3 the shared lib could not be imported (fail-closed — e.g. ship.sh
# copied out of the checkout). ship.sh authorizes ONLY on exit 0 AND a leading APPROVED sentinel.
#
# SECURITY: neither WHICH lib runs nor WHICH tg-ctl is asked is shipper-controllable. The helper
# imports the lib from a fixed path, and resolves tg-ctl off the OS identity's REAL home
# (pwd.getpwuid) — NOT the $HOME env var and NOT the repo worktree — so no ambient env var and no
# rig.yaml a PR commits can redirect approval to an always-approve stub. (SHIP_HATCH_TIMEOUT_S can
# only SHORTEN the wait, which fails CLOSED — a shorter wait denies, never approves — so it is a
# safe tuning knob, not a bypass.)

# --- --skip-ci hatch gate (deny-by-default; one-time live Telegram approval) --------------
# `--skip-ci` is a BLIND admin-merge: it skips the entire green-CI gate AND branch protection
# (`gh pr merge --admin`), verifying nothing locally. The LEGITIMATE "CI is billing-blocked /
# infrastructure is down" case never needs it — the normal (SKIP_CI=0) path auto-detects the
# outage (_empty_rollup_is_ci_outage / ci_appears_structurally_down), runs the local fallback
# gate, and does a NORMAL non-admin merge. So a bare --skip-ci is a pure self-service bypass and
# is DENY-BY-DEFAULT: the ONLY way through is a one-time approval Alex grants live on Telegram,
# requested by setting RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_SHIP_SKIP_CI="<written justification>". No env var an
# agent can set alone unlocks it (a blank/bare "1" is rejected by the helper); authority (tg-ctl)
# is resolved from the account's REAL home, never the repo/cwd — same hardening as the
# review-quorum gate; see ci/ship/skip_ci_hatch.py.

# One skip-ci audit line -> SHIP_AUDIT_FILE, mirroring _review_quorum_audit_log's dry-run contract
# and jq-less JSON-safety. The Python helper owns the non-dry-run bypass:approved/denied line; this
# shell helper records only the cases the helper does NOT (env-absent "refused", and the fail-closed

# --- external-review gate: refuse a merge with ZERO GitHub-side PR reviews ----------------
# WHY: Guard-B (the review-quorum gate above) verifies review-cli's own automated multi-model
# pass for the PR's task code — it is NOT a signal that anyone (human, Codex, a second agent)
# ever looked at THIS PR on GitHub. The unresolved-threads + review-dwell gates further above only
# prove that IF a review posted comments they're resolved, and that there was TIME for one to
# land — neither proves a review actually happened. All three passed for real on PR #764
# (HYP-1380, hyperide/hyper-saas): it merged via `gh ship` with `gh pr view --json reviews`
# returning `[]`, because Guard-B alone was wrongly treated as sufficient. This gate closes that
# gap directly: it queries GitHub's own review list and refuses outright when it is empty.
#
# ORDERING: deliberately placed here, AFTER every non-interactive preflight (local-branch-sanity,
# version-bump, screenshot, review-quorum) and right before the merge — NOT immediately after
# review-dwell, where it originally landed. Reason (review-cli Codex pass, GH-459 iteration 3,
# P1): the interactive path below can contact Alex live on Telegram. Running that BEFORE the
# cheap deterministic gates meant a zero-review PR with a valid hatch justification could burn a
# real-time approval and still refuse later on a dirty worktree / missing version bump / unmet
# quorum — the audit trail would show `bypass:approved` for a ship that never merged. Placing the
# hatch here (matching where review-quorum's own live-approval hatch already sits) means Alex is
# only interrupted once every non-interactive check has already passed and a merge is imminent.
#
# Residual, accepted (review-cli GLM pass, GH-459 iteration 4, P3): the `--skip-ci` hatch runs
# LATER still — inside the merge branches below (`_skip_ci_hatch_gate`), not here — because it
# only applies on the `--skip-ci` path. A ship run as `gh ship --skip-ci` on a zero-review PR
# with BOTH `RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_SHIP_EXTERNAL_REVIEW` and `RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_SHIP_SKIP_CI` set can
# still burn the external-review Telegram approval first and then have --skip-ci's own hatch
# deny afterward — the exact "approved but never merged" shape this relocation otherwise closes,
# just for this one remaining combination. Narrower than the original bug (requires BOTH hatches
# requested simultaneously) and still fails closed (no bad merge happens) — accepted rather than
# further nesting this gate inside both merge branches.
#
# "Qualifying" = at least one entry in `reviews` (any state — APPROVED/COMMENTED/
# CHANGES_REQUESTED/DISMISSED all count, existence is the signal, not the verdict), from ANY
# author, including the PR's own. No self-review exclusion: this repo's PRs are opened under one
# shared GitHub identity regardless of who/what actually did the work (verified against #764 and
# #760 — both authored by the same account that also left a genuine Codex-independent review on
# #760), so filtering by author would wrongly block a real review under that identity. Residual,
# accepted (same threat-model boundary the rest of this script already lives with): a shipper
# who wants to defeat this can leave a trivial self-review — this gate closes the "nobody looked
# at all" case, it is not a content-quality bar.
#
# Deny-by-default, NO self-service flag — an agent-settable override here would just recreate
# the exact failure this gate exists to close. Bypass only via a one-time live Telegram approval:
# RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_SHIP_EXTERNAL_REVIEW="<justification>" (see external_review_hatch.py, which

# --- ticket gates: magic-close keywords + pre-merge acceptance (agent-tools#521) ---------
# Both close the same hole from two sides. task-cli's close gates (every criterion checked WITH
# a proof) only run inside `task done` — but GitHub's "Closes/Fixes/Resolves #N" keywords and
# Linear's GitHub integration (the same words before a ticket code, "Fixes HYP-1295") move the
# ticket to Done the INSTANT the PR merges, entirely outside task-cli. 127 of the 435 HYP
# tickets closed since June 2026 are Done with unchecked criteria (HYP-1440, HYP-1347,
# HYP-1295). A merge gate is the only place that can stop that automation, so:
#   1. the MAGIC-CLOSE gate refuses a PR whose title/body carries such a keyword (the fix is to
#      write "Refs <ref>" — links without closing; `--rewrite-magic-close` does it for you);
#   2. the ACCEPTANCE gate asks task-cli (`task gate <code> --json`) whether the ticket is
#      accepted and refuses while criteria are unchecked or checked without a proof.
# Both run under --dry-run (same refusal; the rewrite is only printed), both log one audit line
# to SHIP_AUDIT_FILE, and each has its own ops off-switch (SHIP_MAGIC_CLOSE_GATE=0,
# SHIP_ACCEPTANCE_GATE=0 — the latter also as a committed .ship-config line).

# The ticket-code derivation is SHARED by the acceptance gate (pre-merge) and the task-cli
# notify step (post-merge) — one matcher, defined once, here, before its first caller.
# Task-code derivation reuses _review_quorum_extract_ticket_candidates (the same matcher the
# review-quorum gate above uses) but tries MORE sources, each candidate validated independently:
# the gate's own $TASK_CODE (if it already ran and found one — avoids a redundant `gh pr view` on
# the common path) → branch → PR TITLE → PR body. The title is a deliberate gap-fix over the
# quorum gate (which only ever tries branch → body): a PR whose ticket code lives only in its
# title (a common shape — "HYP-931: fix the thing") would otherwise never be found here even
# though a human reads it immediately.
#
# EACH candidate — including a reused $TASK_CODE — is validated before being accepted. Within a
# source, EVERY candidate the matcher lists is tried in order and the first survivor wins; only
# when a source has NO survivor does derivation fall to the next source (agent-tools#571: an
# earlier version took only the matcher's first hit per source, so PR #560's incidental `GH-560`
# — rejected as the PR's own number — hid the real `Refs #541` later in the SAME body and the
# gate skipped). A rejected reused $TASK_CODE likewise falls through to the sources (review
# finding on #565: an explicit REVIEW_TASK_CODE=SME-ROADMAP-NOTE, or the branch matching the
# matcher's descriptive arm, used to short-circuit past a title/body that DID carry a real id).
# Every rejection is reported on stderr with its source; the accepted code is reported too, so
# the ship transcript shows which text named the ticket the gates then judge.
#
# The validation is task-cli's OWN id grammar (agent-tools#565), not a loose heuristic. It used
# to be "contains a digit", which is not a shape at all: it admitted things that are not tickets
# and that `task gate`/`task mark-shipped` can only 404 on. Two classes actually reached the
# merge gate on 2026-09-06:
#
#   * review-cli CHECK codes — `rig-cli-341`, `rig-cli-342`, `OC476-OPENCODE-BACKGROUND-TRUTH`
#     — a DIFFERENT entity from a ticket (a recorded review run). Each carries digits, so each
#     passed. `task gate` 404s -> exit 2 -> the acceptance gate logs "could not evaluate" and
#     SKIPS, so PRs 349, 556, 352 and 497 merged with the gate never actually run: it failed
#     OPEN on the very input it was supposed to reject.
#   * the PULL REQUEST's own number, as `GH-<PR>` or `#<PR>`. PR #499 carried its real ticket
#     (#495) in BOTH its branch and its title, but a `GH-499` reuse won the first candidate slot;
#     the gate judged issue #499 — unrelated, zero criteria — and refused. The merge was only
#     unblocked by recording a false post-merge-acceptance opt-out on #499. A PR number is never
#     a ticket id here, so it is rejected explicitly and derivation falls through.
#
# task-cli's grammar (tasklib/cli.py::_route_id_to_project) is exactly three shapes: `#<n>` and
# a bare `<n>` route to GitHub issues; ONE alphanumeric team prefix + `-` + digits (`HYP-931`,
# `PROJ-12`) routes to Linear by that prefix. Anything else cannot be routed at all.
#
# Known, deliberate limit: a prefix shape is indistinguishable from an ordinary hyphenated word
# ending in digits, so a PR title like "Fix UTF-8 decoding" still derives `UTF-8` — it is a
# well-formed id for a team that (almost certainly) does not exist, and task-cli answers exit 2.
# Narrowing that further would need the registered team list, which ship.sh does not have.
_ship_looks_like_a_ticket_id() {  # $1 = candidate code; true (exit 0) iff it has a task-cli id shape

  # bare `<n>` (a GitHub issue), or one letter-led alphanumeric team prefix + a single hyphen +
  # digits only (`HYP-931`, `PROJ-12`). `rig-cli-341` (two hyphens) and
  # `OC476-OPENCODE-BACKGROUND-TRUTH` (non-numeric tail) both fail. `GH-<n>` is a member of the
  # prefix shape like any other; only `_ship_code_names_this_pr` and
  # `_ship_normalize_gh_code_for_task_cli` treat `GH-` as structurally special.

# spellings the code can arrive in — `#<n>`, a bare `<n>`, and the `GH-<n>` convention

# reaches here as "GH-105". The other way a "GH-<n>" code reaches here is $REVIEW_TASK_CODE set by
# hand (or by another tool) following the convention above -- note this is $REVIEW_TASK_CODE
# specifically, not a bare $TASK_CODE env var: the quorum gate (on by default) unconditionally
# overwrites $TASK_CODE from $REVIEW_TASK_CODE at its own assignment above, so an inherited
# $TASK_CODE only survives untouched as an external input when the gate is disabled
# (SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM=0) -- which is how this file's tests drive that path directly.
#
# Either way, this normalization is the one place every path funnels through before reaching
# `task`; a rewrite is logged to stderr so a misrouted ticket (e.g. a repo whose task-cli Linear

# needed) instead of silently going quiet. This is pure notification: `task mark-shipped`
# (task-cli) never closes the ticket itself, only PROPER acceptance does that — see its own
