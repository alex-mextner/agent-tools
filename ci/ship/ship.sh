# ship — green-CI-gated PR merge with pre-merge safety checks, then branch/worktree cleanup.
#
# A portable generalization of a "gh ship <PR>" helper: before merging it verifies the PR is
# actually ready, then squash-merges and cleans up. It refuses to merge when any of these is
# true (each a real way a bad merge sneaks in):
#   • PR is not OPEN / is CONFLICTING / is BEHIND its base (ruleset wants up-to-date).
#   • Required status checks aren't all passing (green-CI gate).
#   • There are unresolved review threads (see ci/review-threads/).
#   • The PR is younger than the review-dwell window (async review hasn't had time to form
#     its questions yet — "0 unresolved threads" is vacuous if no review has posted).
#   • A UI-touching PR has no embedded screenshot (see ci/screenshots/) — unless overridden.
#   • The local branch has unpushed/diverged commits, or its worktree is dirty.
#   • The review-quorum bar (Guard-B of the self-merge-authority program) is not met: the
#     PR's task code has fewer than SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM_MIN_ITER recorded review-cli iterations
#     across SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM_MIN_MODELS distinct models. There is NO self-service override —
#     a one-time bypass goes through a live Telegram approval to Alex (see the hatch escalation
#     below), never a reason flag.
#
# All project-specific coupling is OPTIONAL and configured by env/flags — no issue-tracker,
# no path layout, no org is hard-coded.
#
# Requires: gh (authenticated), git. jq strongly recommended (required-checks-only gating).
#
# Usage:
#   ship.sh <PR-number> [--repo <owner/repo>] [--skip-ci] [--dry-run]
#           [--no-screenshot-ok <reason>] [--screenshot <path> [desc]]...
#
# Flags:
#   --repo <owner/repo>    ship a PR that lives in a DIFFERENT repo than the current checkout:
#                          pins every gh call (view/checks/merge) to owner/repo via GH_REPO.
#                          The only way to ship into a non-CWD repo when a `cd && gh ship`
#                          is not possible. Accepts -R / --repo=… / -R=… / -R… too. When the
#                          target is not this checkout's own origin, remote-branch deletion is
#                          skipped (see the cleanup guard) so the wrong remote is never touched.
#   --skip-ci              admin-merge bypassing the green-CI gate (use only when CI is
#                          billing-blocked / stuck — it still runs the other preflights).
#   --dry-run              print what would happen; change nothing.
#   --no-screenshot-ok R   override the UI screenshot requirement with a logged reason R.
#   --no-version-bump-ok R override the version-bump requirement with a logged reason R
#                          (genuine no-release ship: docs-only, pure test/CI, a revert).
#   --no-review-dwell-ok R override the review-dwell window with a logged reason R (a genuine
#                          fast-track: a trivial/urgent merge that doesn't need review latency).
#   --screenshot P [D]     attach a local screenshot P (desc D) via SHIP_IMAGE_UPLOAD_CMD,
#                          then post it as a PR comment. Repeatable.
#
# NOTE: the review-quorum gate (Guard-B) has NO override FLAG. When its bar is not met and you
# genuinely need to proceed, request a one-time bypass by setting the env var
#   RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM="<justification>"
# which asks Alex live on Telegram (via the shared agenttools_hatch_escalation lib) and proceeds
# ONLY on his real-time approval. SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM=0 disables the whole gate (ops off-switch).
#
# Knobs (env):
#   SHIP_MAIN_CHECKOUT     path to the primary (main) checkout for the post-merge pull.
#                          Default: first worktree in `git worktree list`.
#   SHIP_DEFAULT_BRANCH    base branch name (default: main).
#   SHIP_UI_PATH_REGEX     ERE; changed files matching it => "UI-touching" (screenshot
#                          required). Default covers common front-end paths. Empty = never
#                          treat as UI (disables the screenshot gate).
#   SHIP_MERGE_METHOD      squash | merge | rebase (default: squash).
#   SHIP_IMAGE_UPLOAD_CMD  optional command to upload a screenshot and PRINT a public URL on
#                          stdout. Receives the image path as {FILE} (or as $1 if no token).
#                          Used only with --screenshot. If unset, --screenshot embeds a
#                          local-path note instead (does NOT satisfy the screenshot gate).
#   SHIP_SKIP_VERSION_BUMP=1  override the version-bump gate (same effect as
#                          --no-version-bump-ok, with a generic env-set reason). Use only for a
#                          genuine no-release ship.
#   SHIP_VERSION_FILES     space-separated list of version files to check (relative to the repo
#                          root). Default: auto-detect pyproject.toml then package.json at the
#                          root. Set it for a non-standard layout (e.g. a nested package).
#   SHIP_REVIEW_DWELL      minimum seconds since the PR's last code push before a merge is
#                          allowed, so asynchronous review (multi-model / CI-AI / human) has
#                          time to FORM its comments. Default 600 (10 min). 0 disables the gate.
#   REVIEW_TASK_CODE       the task/ticket code (e.g. HYP-931) this ship belongs to, for the
#                          review-quorum gate. If unset, ship derives it from a ticket-like
#                          token in the branch name, then the PR body. If none is found, the
#                          gate refuses (fail-closed) with guidance.
#   SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM_ENABLED / SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM  set either to 0 to disable the
#                          review-quorum gate entirely (default: enabled).
#   SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM_MIN_ITER    quorum floor: recorded review-cli iterations (default 3).
#   SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM_MIN_MODELS  quorum floor: distinct models (default 3).
#   RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM  one-time bypass request for the review-quorum gate:
#                          set it to a written justification to ask Alex live on Telegram (via
#                          the shared agenttools_hatch_escalation lib); the gate proceeds ONLY on
#                          his real-time approval. Blank/bare-flag values are denied; unset means
#                          no bypass requested (the gate refuses with guidance).
#   SHIP_HATCH_LIB_DIR     override the lib/ dir the hatch escalation imports from (default:
#                          derived from this script's location). Tests point it at the checkout.
#   SHIP_AUDIT_FILE        path for the review-quorum gate's audit JSONL (default
#                          ~/.config/agent-tools/ship-audit.jsonl). One line is appended per
#                          gated ship (authorized / bypass:approved / bypass:denied / refused).

# --- core.bare corruption guard --------------------------------------------------------
# A WORKING checkout whose `git config core.bare` is wrongly `true` is a real corruption
# class (external cause — see rig-cli #19/#52, where `rig doctor --fix` repairs it). It
# breaks EVERY git op in that directory (status / diff / commit / worktree all fail fatal
# with "this operation must be run in a work tree"), so ship's later main-refresh /
# worktree ops would fail CONFUSINGLY mid-ship (it bit a real ship this session). We catch
# it EARLY — before any destructive git op on the checkout — and ABORT (exit 1, ship's
# uniform "Refusing:" preflight code) with the repo + the one-line fix, rather than auto-fix
# (ship must never silently rewrite repo config).
#
# Detection keys off git's per-path `rev-parse --is-bare-repository` verdict (NOT a raw
# `core.bare` config read, NOT `worktree list`'s bare marker): both of those read `true` for a
# LEGITIMATE linked worktree of a genuine bare repo (shared config), whereas rev-parse correctly
# reports such a worktree as not-bare — at the worktree root AND from any subdirectory of it.
# That single property is the false-positive shield, so the two entry points below differ only
# in WHERE they look, not in the test:
#   • abort_if_core_bare DIR — used for an explicit checkout/worktree PATH (the main checkout,
#     each linked worktree). It also requires the WORKING-checkout layout (`.git` at DIR's root)
#     so a genuine bare repo dir (`foo.git`, no `.git` entry, rev-parse=true) is excluded.
#   • abort_if_cwd_core_bare — used for the AMBIENT cwd, which may be a SUBDIRECTORY of the
#     corrupt checkout (the realistic "ship launched from inside it" shape). `.git` lives only
#     at the worktree root, so the DIR layout gate above would wrongly pass a subdir. We can't
#     drop the genuine-bare exclusion entirely, though: a GENUINE bare repo (`foo.git`) — or any
#     subdir inside one — also reports rev-parse=bare, but there `core.bare=true` is LEGITIMATE,
#     so firing the "corruption" diagnostic (and worse, telling the user to run `config core.bare
#     false`, which would BREAK a real bare repo) is actively wrong. The clean discriminator,
#     evaluable from a subdir, is `rev-parse --is-inside-git-dir`: it is FALSE in a corrupt
#     working checkout (cwd is a work tree) but TRUE inside a genuine bare repo (the bare dir IS
#     the git dir). We also require a `.git` entry somewhere in the cwd's ancestry (present for a
#     working checkout, absent for a bare repo) as belt-and-suspenders.
# $3 is the exact fix command to print. It MUST match where core.bare actually lives: a plain
# `git config core.bare false` writes the SHARED config, but a WORKTREE-SCOPED core.bare=true
# (extensions.worktreeConfig + `config --worktree core.bare true`) keeps winning over a shared
# `false`, so for that case the fix must be `config --worktree core.bare false`. Callers compute
# the right command (see core_bare_fix_cmd) so the printed advice actually repairs the repo.

# ALREADY EXIST. "0 unresolved threads" is ALSO true when no review has POSTED yet — so a PR
# opened and shipped within seconds passes that gate vacuously, before any multi-model / CI-AI /
# human review could form its questions. This gate enforces a minimum DWELL window since the PR's
# last code push, so a review has time to land; whatever it then posts becomes a thread the gate
# above forces resolved. Together they mean: comments get TIME to form AND must be resolved.
#
# Runs INDEPENDENTLY of --skip-ci: a premature merge is premature regardless of CI billing.
#
# The window starts at max(createdAt, pushedDate, committedDate, forcePushedAt):
#   • createdAt — the floor; a reviewer can't review before the PR exists, so even a PR built
#     from an old commit waits from PR-open.
#   • pushedDate — GitHub-CONTROLLED head-update time (when GitHub received the push). Reliable
#     for normal pushes but can be null (deprecated on the Commit object) and stale on force-pushes
#     to an already-on-GitHub commit.
#   • committedDate — the embedded commit date. Reliable fallback for pushedDate==null on the common
#     commit→push / rebase→push path.
#   • forcePushedAt — HeadRefForcePushedEvent.createdAt (last event); the authoritative signal
#     that the PR head was force-pushed to an old commit where pushedDate would be stale.
# Override with --no-review-dwell-ok <reason> (logged) or SHIP_REVIEW_DWELL=0 to disable.

# exclusion set below; the version file is auto-located (pyproject.toml `version =`, then
# package.json `"version"`) or pinned via SHIP_VERSION_FILES.

# A path is NON-shippable (does NOT, on its own, make a ship a release) iff it is docs, a

# --- review-quorum preflight gate (Guard-B, self-merge-authority program) --------------
# WHY this exists: the earlier gates verify CI is green and human/AI review THREADS are
# resolved, but neither proves an actual multi-model review RAN. This gate is the "strictly
# controlled" guarantee — it hard-refuses the merge unless review-cli's own record shows the
# PR's task code has enough recorded review iterations across enough distinct models (a
# STRUCTURAL check on runs that were dispatched, not on their verdicts — see `review task
# --help`). Fail-CLOSED: a missing `review` CLI, an unreadable store, or no derivable task
# code all refuse rather than merge unverified.
#
# There is NO self-service override. When the bar is not met (or cannot be verified) and the
# agent genuinely needs to proceed, it sets RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM="<justification>";
# that routes through the shared agenttools_hatch_escalation lib (the SAME lib the
# pin-primary-worktree / block-reset-hard agent-hooks use) to ask Alex live on Telegram, and the
# gate proceeds ONLY on his real-time approval. SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM=0 disables the whole gate.
#
# Runs independently of --skip-ci, same posture as the review-dwell gate above.

# Prints the first ticket-like token found in $1, or nothing. Tries the repo's own HYP-<n>
# convention first (case-insensitive, normalized to uppercase), then a generic
# UPPERCASE-PREFIX-<n> ticket token (2+ uppercase letters, a hyphen, digits) so other repos'
# conventions (JIRA-style PROJ-123, etc.) are also picked up. The generic pattern is
# deliberately uppercase-only so it doesn't false-match ordinary prose like "utf-8" or "step-2".

# has uncommitted changes that conflict with the incoming pull.  If the stash-pop
