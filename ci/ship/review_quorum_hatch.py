"""One-time Telegram hatch escalation for ship's review-quorum gate (Guard-B).

Reached at runtime ONLY from ci/ship/ship.sh, when the review-quorum bar is not met (or cannot
be verified) AND the shipper set RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM. It delegates to the shared
agenttools_hatch_escalation lib — the SAME lib the pin-primary-worktree / block-reset-hard
agent-hooks use — to ask Alex live on Telegram (`tg-ctl ask`) and returns his real-time verdict.

Invariants (why a bypass here can't be self-authorized):
  * The shared lib is imported from a FIXED path (lib/ two levels above this file), never an env
    var — so a shipper can't point it at an always-approve stub.
  * tg-ctl is resolved by the lib from the account's REAL home (pwd.getpwuid(os.getuid()).pw_dir),
    NOT the $HOME env var and NOT the repo being merged. So neither an ambient env var nor a
    rig.yaml a PR commits can redirect approval; only a rig.yaml in the real account home (a
    global, reviewed location) may override tg-ctl, else the lib's hard-coded trusted-paths
    allowlist (the real tg-ctl) is used.
  * In a real run this module writes its OWN audit line for the hatch outcome
    (bypass:approved / bypass:denied), so the record is single-source and testable in-process.
    In dry-run it writes no persistent audit; ship.sh prints the would-be audit line.

Past bug: an earlier revision resolved tg-ctl from the repo worktree (cwd=os.getcwd()) and then
from $HOME — both shipper/PR-controllable, letting a committed or env-pointed rig.yaml self-approve
(codex review P0/P1 on PR #225). Fixed by keying resolution off the OS identity's home only.

Exit codes (read by ship.sh): 0 approved, 1 requested-but-not-approved (blank/bare/denied/
timeout), 2 not requested (should not happen — ship only calls this when the env var is set),
3 the shared lib could not be imported (fail-closed).
