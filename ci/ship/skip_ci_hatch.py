"""One-time Telegram hatch escalation for ship's --skip-ci CI-bypass gate.

Reached at runtime ONLY from ci/ship/ship.sh, when the shipper passed `--skip-ci` (a blind
admin-merge that skips the whole green-CI gate AND branch protection) AND set
RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_SHIP_SKIP_CI. It delegates to the shared agenttools_hatch_escalation lib — the
SAME lib the review-quorum gate / pin-primary-worktree / block-reset-hard agent-hooks use — to ask
Alex live on Telegram (`tg-ctl ask`) and returns his real-time verdict. There is NO self-service
override; `--skip-ci` is deny-by-default and the intended path is a live approval. (Threat-model
caveat, identical to the review-quorum gate: a shipper who fully controls the ship PROCESS's PATH
can defeat ANY gate — a fake `python3` that prints `APPROVED` and exits 0, a fake `gh`/`git`, etc.
The `-I` isolation + fixed-path lib import defend against injecting a self-approving MODULE and
remove the fail-OPEN asymmetry for a benign shipper; they are not a claim to withstand a hostile
PATH — that threat is out of scope here as it is everywhere else in ship.)

Why this gate exists: the LEGITIMATE "CI is billing-blocked / infrastructure is down" case is
already handled automatically WITHOUT --skip-ci — on the normal (SKIP_CI=0) path ship detects the
outage (`_empty_rollup_is_ci_outage` / `ci_appears_structurally_down`), runs the local fallback
gate, and does a NORMAL non-admin merge. So a bare `--skip-ci` is purely a blind, self-service
admin bypass that verifies nothing and overrides branch protection — exactly the thing that must
require an explicit human approval, not an agent-settable flag.

Invariants (why a bypass here can't be self-authorized) — identical to review_quorum_hatch.py:
  * The shared lib is imported from a FIXED path (lib/ two levels above this file), never an env
    var — so a shipper can't point it at an always-approve stub.
  * tg-ctl is resolved by the lib from the account's REAL home (pwd.getpwuid(os.getuid()).pw_dir),
    NOT the $HOME env var and NOT the repo being merged. So neither an ambient env var nor a
    rig.yaml a PR commits can redirect approval; only a rig.yaml in the real account home (a
    global, reviewed location) may override tg-ctl, else the lib's hard-coded trusted-paths
    allowlist (the real tg-ctl) is used.
  * ship.sh runs this under `python3 -I` (isolated: ignores PYTHONPATH/PYTHONHOME/user-site and
    skips sitecustomize), so no startup hook can run first and self-approve.
  * In a real run this module writes its OWN audit line for the hatch outcome
    (skipci:bypass:approved / skipci:bypass:denied), so the record is single-source.

Dry-run divergence from review_quorum_hatch.py (deliberate): `--skip-ci --dry-run` is a PREVIEW
that never actually merges, so it must not fire a live Telegram round-trip. In dry-run this helper
sends NO message but still enforces deny-by-default at the justification level — a blank/bare
RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_SHIP_SKIP_CI is DENIED, a real written justification prints an APPROVED sentinel
annotated "would request Telegram approval". The real (non-dry-run) merge ALWAYS requires a live
approval; a justification alone never unlocks a real admin merge.

Exit codes (read by ship.sh): 0 approved, 1 requested-but-not-approved (blank/bare/denied/
timeout), 2 not requested (should not happen — ship only calls this when the env var is set),
3 the shared lib could not be imported (fail-closed).
