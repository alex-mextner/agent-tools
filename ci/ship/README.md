# ship — green-CI-gated PR merge + cleanup

`ship.sh <PR>` is a portable "merge this PR safely, then clean up" helper. It is **not** a
CI workflow — it's a local/CI command you run to merge a ready PR. Before it merges, it
runs the same preflights the CI gates in this directory enforce, so you can't merge a PR
that isn't actually ready even with a one-liner.

## What it refuses to merge

| Refusal | Why |
| ------- | --- |
| PR not OPEN / CONFLICTING / BEHIND base | Not mergeable / ruleset wants up-to-date branch. |
| **No CI checks at all** | "No CI" is a *failed* gate, not a pass — ship refuses and tells you to set CI up first (`rig apply` provisions the gates, or add workflows). Override only with `--skip-ci`, which is **deny-by-default** (needs a one-time live Telegram approval — see below). **Exception — CI outage:** if the empty rollup is a genuine outage (a `pull_request`-triggered workflow exists on the PR's **pushed base branch** — `origin/<baseRefName>` — but registered no checks, i.e. billing suspended / Actions down), ship runs the local fallback gate below instead of refusing, and — only if it is fully green — falls through to the **normal (non-admin) merge** (the same posture as the checks-failed structural-outage path; a branch-protection ruleset still gates it, and if required checks are genuinely absent GitHub blocks the merge so you `--skip-ci` deliberately — ship never silently `--admin`-bypasses here). A failed/unreadable rollup query is NOT an empty rollup — an unknown remote state hard-refuses (never merges). A repo whose workflows never trigger on PRs (push/schedule only) is NOT an outage and still hard-refuses. The signal is read from the pushed `origin/<base>` ref, not the local worktree, so an untracked/unpushed workflow cannot trigger the exception. **Trigger detection is a heuristic** over a YAML subset: it recognises an unquoted top-level `on:` naming `pull_request`/`pull_request_target` inline, as a block key, or as a list item; a `pull_request` trigger **narrowed by `branches:`/`paths:`/`types:` filters is still treated as an outage** (the local gate then runs, so the merge is verified — it is only more permissive about substituting local gates for absent remote checks), and quoted-key (`"on":`) / flow-mapping (`on: { … }`) forms conservatively hard-refuse (the safe direction). |
| Any CI check's latest run failing | The green-CI gate (gates on ALL checks, by each check's LATEST run — the rollup is deduped to the newest run per logical check, so a stale FAILURE from a re-run that has since gone green does not block, matching GitHub's `mergeStateStatus`). **Exception — a confirmed pre-existing flake:** below the ~80% "CI is structurally down" threshold (see `ci_appears_structurally_down` above), the far more common shape is "one specific check is a flaky, already-broken-on-main test and everything else is green" — that never looks like an outage, so without help the only way through used to be a human escalation for something a quick check of the base branch's own recent CI history already answers. Pass `--known-flake <check-name>` (repeatable, once per currently-failing check) to name the claim; ship does **not** trust it — it independently queries the last `SHIP_FLAKE_LOOKBACK_RUNS` (default 5) completed runs of the SAME workflow on the PR's own base branch and requires a job of that exact name to have also FAILED in at least one of them. Every currently-failing check must be BOTH asserted AND confirmed this way, or the gate still hard-refuses (no partial credit) — an assertion that doesn't check out is refused identically to not passing the flag at all. On success it runs the SAME local fallback gate as the CI-down path and merges only if that is green too — a confirmed flake is not a free pass on testing. Logged to `SHIP_AUDIT_FILE` (`gate:"known-flake"`, `decision: confirmed`/`confirmed-local-gate-failed`/`refused` — `confirmed` is written only after an actual merge, never for a run that stopped short). Scope, stated plainly: this confirms the check NAME has also failed recently on the base branch — job-name granularity, not proof the SAME sub-test failed both times (a monorepo-wide test job could in principle fail for two different reasons); the refusal message that leads you here always prints exactly what failed, so look before asserting. **Known gap:** if the flaky check is also a *required* status check under branch protection, GitHub can still refuse the final `gh pr merge` even after this gate and the local tests pass (a required check FAILING still blocks, unlike the empty-rollup case above where nothing failed, it was merely absent) — you'd land at the `--skip-ci` hatch anyway. Not unsafe, just an unresolved UX gap. |
| CI still running | Ship **watches** pending checks to completion (polls every `SHIP_CI_POLL`s up to `SHIP_CI_WAIT`s) instead of refusing — you don't babysit. |
| Unresolved review threads | Same check as [`../review-threads/`](../review-threads/). Pass `--resolve-addressed-threads` to let ship first auto-close the threads that are safe without a human — unresolved + outdated (addressed by a later commit) + authored entirely by bots; human or unaddressed threads still block (see Flags, #268). |
| **PR younger than the review-dwell window** | Closes the premature-merge gap: the unresolved-threads check above only fails when threads *already exist*, so "0 unresolved threads" is **vacuously true** before any review has posted — a PR opened and shipped within seconds passes it without a single question forming. The dwell gate refuses until at least `SHIP_REVIEW_DWELL` seconds (default **600 / 10 min**) have elapsed since the PR's last code push, giving async review (multi-model / CI-AI / human) time to form its comments (which then become threads the check above forces resolved). Runs **independently of `--skip-ci`**. Window starts at `max(createdAt, head-commit committedDate)` so a new push restarts it — except ship's **own** merge-time bump commit (and the update-branch merge right before it), which is skipped so the auto-bump never resets the clock (#518). Disable with `SHIP_REVIEW_DWELL=0`; override one ship with `--no-review-dwell-ok <reason>` (logged). Fail-closed: unreadable/unparseable timestamps refuse. |
| **PR has ZERO GitHub-side reviews** | Closes a DIFFERENT gap from the two rows above: the unresolved-threads check and the dwell window are both vacuously satisfiable when literally nobody ever reviewed — dwell only buys *time* for a review to land, it never checks whether one actually did. `gh pr view --json reviews` must return at least one entry (any state — `APPROVED`/`COMMENTED`/`CHANGES_REQUESTED`/`DISMISSED` all count, any author including the PR's own — existence is the signal, not the verdict; a self-review defeats this the same way a shipper controlling the process can defeat any other gate here). Real incident: PR #764 in hyperide/hyper-saas merged via `gh ship` with zero reviews, on Guard-B (review-cli's automated pass) alone — a **separate** signal from an actual GitHub-side review. Runs **independently of `--skip-ci`**. Disable with `SHIP_EXTERNAL_REVIEW_ENABLED=0` (or `SHIP_EXTERNAL_REVIEW=0`). There is **NO self-service override flag** — a one-time bypass is requested via `RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_SHIP_EXTERNAL_REVIEW="<justification>"` (same shared `agenttools_hatch_escalation` lib as the review-quorum/`--skip-ci` hatches; `ci/ship/external_review_hatch.py`). Audited to `SHIP_AUDIT_FILE` (`gate:"external-review"`, decision `external-review:refused` / `external-review:bypass:approved` / `external-review:bypass:denied`). |
| UI-touching PR with no screenshot | Same check as [`../screenshots/`](../screenshots/); override with `--no-screenshot-ok`. |
| **Shippable source changed but the version is UNCHANGED** | A ship of source is a release; the declared version (`pyproject.toml` `version`/`package.json` `"version"`) must be bumped so `--version` stays a real freshness signal (skill: `bump-version-on-release`). Docs-only / pure test/CI PRs are exempt. **By default ship makes the bump itself at merge time** (see the next row); this refusal fires only when that is opted out (`SHIP_AUTO_BUMP=0`) or cannot run (the message says why). Override a genuine no-release ship with `--no-version-bump-ok <reason>` (or `SHIP_SKIP_VERSION_BUMP=1`). |
| **Merge-time version auto-bump** (#518, default ON) | The per-PR bump rule made every parallel PR bump the same line to the same next version, so the second one to merge was CONFLICTING and needed a hand rebase + re-bump. Now, when the row above would refuse, ship computes the next **PATCH** version and commits it **onto the PR's HEAD branch through the GitHub Contents API** (`chore(release): bump version X -> Y (ship auto-bump for #N)`) — a direct commit to main is impossible under the rulesets, an API commit is GitHub-signed and fires no local git hook, and the PR's own squash carries it into main. Every gate accounts for that commit: **branch sanity runs first** (a diverged/dirty local branch refuses before anything is pushed); if the base's version already moved past this PR's merge-base (the previous PR in the queue was bumped), the branch is first **updated from base** via the update-branch API — without that the squash three-way merge (merge-base X, base X+1, head X+2) would conflict on the very line this exists to keep clean — then bumped X+1 -> X+2; the **green-CI gate waits on the new head SHA** (the head oid is confirmed first; the check-registration grace is widened to `SHIP_AUTO_BUMP_CI_GRACE`); **review-dwell is measured from the last NON-ship push** — ship's own bump commit carries a fixed, distinctive **committer identity** set explicitly on the Contents API PUT (nothing else in the pipeline writes it), and the dwell query recursively peels trailing commits matched by that identity, plus (for each) one immediately preceding update-branch-shaped merge commit, over a widened lookback — this is IDENTITY-based, not message-text-based, so an innocent human commit that happens to contain similar wording can never be mistaken for ship's own, and any number of stacked ship attempts across refused re-runs are peeled correctly; a **bot thread on the bump line is auto-resolved** (same bot-only + no-high-severity-marker + readable-body predicate as `--resolve-addressed-threads`; a human thread, a severity-tagged one, or one elsewhere still blocks); the local worktree is **fast-forwarded**; the review-quorum record is keyed by task code and its diff-identity check still overlaps the PR's files, so it stays valid; one **`version-bump:auto`** line (pr, file, old, new, sha, branch) goes to `SHIP_AUDIT_FILE`. A PR that already bumps **past** the base (a deliberate minor/major) gets no second bump; a hand-bump that the base already reached (the race) is re-bumped on top of base. A repo with no version file keeps the note-and-skip. `--dry-run` prints the plan (file, old -> new, whether the branch would be updated) and pushes nothing. **Fail-closed on the push**: a rejected API write refuses with the API's reason and nothing is merged; red CI after the bump refuses in the CI gate and leaves the bump commit on the branch (a re-run sees the PR as already bumped). Opt out per repo with `SHIP_AUTO_BUMP=0` in the committed `.ship-config`, or per run with the env var. **A generic BEHIND-clearing attempt runs at the PR-state preflight itself** (before this row's own logic, and independent of whether the version file diverged): a queued PR reporting `mergeStateStatus=BEHIND` under a require-up-to-date-branches ruleset — which happens the instant ANY prior PR merges, not only a version-bumped one — is updated from its base via the same update-branch API before ship gives up, so the acceptance scenario ("two PRs shipped back to back both merge without a conflict") holds even on repos enforcing that ruleset; a genuine content conflict in that update still refuses with the original `gh pr update-branch` guidance. Residual: a PR that hand-bumped to a version the base has since passed (PR at 1.0.1, base at 1.0.3) still conflicts in update-branch and is refused — merge base into it by hand; a human's own conflict-resolution merge landing immediately before a ship re-bump is (rarely) swept into the dwell skip along with it, since GitHub's update-branch merge message isn't otherwise distinguishable from a human's identically-worded one; a repo that requires **signed commits on the PR head branch itself** (not just `main`) may reject or leave unverified the bump commit, since it carries an explicit committer identity rather than the authenticated token's own (needed so the review-dwell gate can recognize it) — set `SHIP_AUTO_BUMP=0` there; **`locate_version_file`'s `version =` match is the FIRST such line in `pyproject.toml`** (pre-existing behavior of the version-bump gate this feature reuses, not new to it) — a Poetry-style file with a dependency pin's own `version = "X"` ahead of `[project]` can match the wrong line; keep the project's own `version` field first, or set `SHIP_VERSION_FILES` to a file where it's unambiguous. |
| **Review-quorum bar not met** (Guard-B, self-merge-authority) | The gate that makes self-merge *"strictly controlled"*. Before merging, ship derives the PR's task code (`$REVIEW_TASK_CODE`, else a `HYP-<n>`/uppercase ticket token, else a purely descriptive ALL-CAPS/hyphenated code — `SME-ROADMAP-WORKTREE-NOTE`-shaped, 3+ segments, no digits — else, as the last fallback, a keyword-anchored GitHub issue reference — `Fixes #105`/`Refs #105`, kept literal as `#105` for repos that track work as plain GitHub issues; a bare `#105`, a cross-repo `org/repo#105`, a URL fragment, or two DISTINCT anchored refs in one text never qualify — tried against the branch name, then the PR body) and asks review-cli whether that task has >= `SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM_MIN_ITER` **PASSED** review iterations across >= `SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM_MIN_ROLES` distinct **BOARD ROLES** among those passed iterations (`review task <code> --check --min-roles N`, retrying without `--min-roles` if the installed review-cli predates role support — review-cli's own history shows no build ever supported both `--quorum-check` and `--min-roles`, so a role-less retry (still reporting real iteration/model data, honestly 0 roles) comes before the legacy `--quorum-check` fallback for pre-rename builds — a failed/degraded review does not count toward the bar). Role-based coverage is the **PRIMARY/default mechanism now** (matching review-cli's own default, review-cli#246) — `--min-roles` is always sent. `SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM_MIN_MODELS` is enforced **ADDITIONALLY, only when the operator explicitly sets it** — there is no default model floor any more; ship sends `--min-models` to review-cli only in that case, mirroring review-cli's own explicit-vs-default AND logic so an explicit model-floor request can never be silently outvoted by role coverage (or the reverse). All floors are **clamped to a hard minimum of 3** (raise-only; a `0`/negative/below-3 value resolves to 3). Bar met -> ship **re-derives the verdict from the counts** (never trusts the subprocess's `passed` boolean alone), prints `AUTHORITY CONFIRMED`, and proceeds. Bar not met, a quorum reading 0 iterations / 0 distinct roles, no task code, `review`/`jq` missing, or the store unreadable -> **fail-closed refuse**. There is **NO self-service override flag**: a one-time bypass is requested by setting `RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM="<justification>"`, which asks Alex **live on Telegram** (via the shared `agenttools_hatch_escalation` lib) and proceeds ONLY on his real-time approval — a blank/bare value is denied. Runs **independently of `--skip-ci`**. Every non-dry-run gated ship appends an audit line (`authorized` / `bypass:approved` / `bypass:denied` / `refused`, now carrying `roles`/`min_roles`/`min_models` alongside `models` — `min_models` reads `0` when the model floor was not enforced) to `SHIP_AUDIT_FILE`; `--dry-run` prints the would-be audit instead. Disable the whole gate with `SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM=0`. |
| **Magic-close keyword in the PR title/body/commits** (`Closes #115`, `Fixes HYP-1295`, `Fixes https://github.com/acme/widgets/issues/115`, …) | GitHub's `close/closes/closed/fix/fixes/fixed/resolve/resolves/resolved` (+ Linear's `-ing` forms) followed by `#N`, `owner/repo#N`, a ticket code (`ABC-123`), or a full `https://…/issues/N` or `…/pull/N` URL (GitHub documents the URL form as an equally valid close target) makes GitHub / Linear's GitHub integration move the ticket to **Done the instant the PR merges** — behind task-cli's close gates, so the ticket ends up Done with empty checkboxes (127 of 435 HYP tickets since June 2026; HYP-1440, HYP-1347, HYP-1295). Scans the PR title, body, **and every commit message** (GitHub's default squash-message template includes each commit's message in the final commit body, so a clean title/body with a keyword buried in one commit can still close the ticket). Ship refuses and prints the exact phrase(s) (`in the body: "Closes #115"`, `in a commit: "Closes HYP-1295"`) with the fix: write **`Refs <ref>`** (links without closing). `--rewrite-magic-close` rewrites a title/body keyword to `Refs` via `gh pr edit` and continues (audited, `decision: rewritten`) — a keyword found in a COMMIT message has **no automatic fix** (this script never rewrites or rebases a branch) and **still refuses even when a title/body keyword coexists**: the title/body rewrite still lands (harmless, worth keeping), but rewriting the PR text does nothing to stop the un-rewritable commit message from closing the ticket, so the ship is refused either way, with the commit needing a manual amend. A `gh pr view` fetch failure (rate limit, network blip) **fails closed** — refused, never treated as "no keyword found". Detection is whitespace-normalized (a linebreak between keyword and reference — `"Fixes\n#115"` — still matches, since GitHub's own parser is whitespace-tolerant there); before ever calling `gh pr edit`, ship checks the REWRITE RESULT itself and refuses instead of editing if a keyword would still be present (the line-based rewrite sed can't reach a cross-line phrase) — a local check, not a post-edit re-fetch, so it behaves identically under `--dry-run` and has nothing to fail open on if GitHub is briefly unreachable. Case-insensitive; a colon between keyword and reference is NOT a close (`fix: HYP-1295 …` conventional titles pass). Runs under `--dry-run` (same refusal; the edit is only printed). Audited to `SHIP_AUDIT_FILE` (`gate:"magic-close"`, `refused` / `rewritten`, matched phrases in `detail`). Disable with `SHIP_MAGIC_CLOSE_GATE=0`. |
| **Ticket not accepted** (`task gate <code>` exit 1) | The pre-merge **acceptance gate** (task-cli#115 / #521). When task-cli is on PATH and a ticket code is derivable (branch → PR title → PR body — the same derivation the post-merge notify uses), ship runs `task gate <code> --json` BEFORE merging and refuses while the ticket has **unchecked** criteria or criteria **checked without a proof** — printing them (`[3] survives a restart (unchecked)`) with the fix (`task accept <code>` / `task check <code> <n> … --proof …`). A ticket whose acceptance is inherently post-merge (a release publish) records `task change <code> --post-merge-acceptance "<reason>"` ON the ticket: the gate then passes and the reason lands in the audit line (`decision: authorized:post-merge-opt-out`). task-cli absent / foreign `--repo` / no derivable code / `task gate` exit 2 (could not evaluate — unknown ticket, backend error) → logged **skip**, never a refusal. `task` is an AMBIGUOUS binary name (Taskwarrior, go-task also install as `task`) — an exit 0 OR 1 whose output does NOT carry task-cli's own JSON shape (`id`/`ok`/`criteria`) is treated as "not task-cli", not a genuine acceptance or refusal, and skips instead of blocking every merge (or, worse, silently authorizing one). Runs under `--dry-run`. Disable with `SHIP_ACCEPTANCE_GATE=0` (env, or a committed `.ship-config` line). Contract below. |
| Local branch has unpushed/diverged commits, or dirty worktree | Avoids merging stale/uncommitted local state. |

Then it squash-merges, deletes the remote branch, removes the local branch+worktree
(unless you're *inside* that worktree — then it's left so your session keeps a cwd), and
fast-forwards your main checkout.

When ship decides CI is structurally unavailable and runs its local fallback gates, the
test runner picks a command in this order (highest priority first):

1. **`SHIP_LOCAL_TEST_CMD` env var** — test-only escape hatch, never set in production.
2. **`.ship-config` file, committed at the repo root** — an audited, per-repo override for
   repos where auto-detection can't guess correctly (e.g. a monorepo-of-fixtures whose real
   suite lives in a subdirectory, like a project with no root-level manifest). Simple
   `KEY=value` lines, three whitelisted keys: `SHIP_LOCAL_TEST_DIR=<path>` (a repo-relative
   subdirectory to run the command from, or to scope auto-detection to),
   `SHIP_LOCAL_TEST_CMD=<cmd>` (a command line, eval'd the same way as the env var of the
   same name — this is just a committed, per-repo source for it), and `SHIP_AUTO_BUMP=0`
   (opt this repo out of the merge-time version auto-bump — unrelated to the local gate, it
   just shares the audited file; the env var of the same name wins when set). The file is read from the
   last **committed** content at `HEAD` (`git show HEAD:.ship-config`), never the working
   tree, so an uncommitted/staged-only edit is not honored — the "audited" claim is an
   enforced property. `SHIP_LOCAL_TEST_DIR` is rejected (and invalidates the whole file) if
   it's absolute, contains a `..` path component, or resolves to the repo root itself.
3. **`dev run --repo-only test`** if the repo has a committed `rig.yaml`, that file declares
   top-level `scripts.test`, and `dev` is on PATH. Probe/runtime errors from
   `dev has-script --repo-only test` block instead of silently guessing a fallback runner.
   If `dev` is installed, install it with its runtime dependencies (`agenttools-config`/
   PyYAML); repos with `rig.yaml` fail closed on dependency or config errors so a declared
   script is not bypassed by auto-detection. A PATH `dev` must answer the hidden
   `dev --agenttools-dev-probe`; unrelated tools named `dev` are ignored and ship falls back
   to stack detection.
4. **Root-level auto-detection** — the portable pyproject/package/Cargo detection in
   `ship.sh`, at the repo root.
5. **`e2e/` subdirectory auto-detection** — the same three manifests, one level down, in
   `e2e/` ONLY. `test/` and `tests/` are deliberately never auto-probed (those directory
   names are also where repos most often keep fixture manifests unrelated to the real
   suite) — use `.ship-config` for any other/ambiguous subdirectory layout.

If nothing above matches, ship fails closed with "no recognized test runner found" rather
than merging unverified.

## Quick start

```bash
cp ci/ship/ship.sh ~/bin/ship && chmod +x ~/bin/ship    # or wherever your PATH points
ship 123                                                # merge PR #123 when green
ship 123 --dry-run                                      # show what it would do
ship 123 --screenshot ./after.png "new dialog"          # attach + post visual proof
```

Wire it as a `gh` alias if you like:

```bash
gh alias set ship '!bash ~/bin/ship'    # then: gh ship 123
```

> **Hatch bypass needs the sibling `lib/`.** The review-quorum gate's one-time Telegram bypass
> imports `agenttools_hatch_escalation` from `lib/` two levels above `ship.sh` in the checkout.
> The sanctioned `gh ship` → `pr-ship.sh` delegator runs the **canonical catalog** `ci/ship/ship.sh`
> (resolved from the repo checkout or `AGENT_TOOLS_ROOT`), so `lib/` is present and the bypass works.
> A bare `cp ci/ship/ship.sh ~/bin/ship` copy has no sibling `lib/`, so a bypass request from it
> **fails closed** (the gate still enforces; you just can't hatch-bypass) — run `ship` from the
> checkout, or point `AGENT_TOOLS_ROOT` at it, to use the bypass.

> **Trust model — run `gh ship` from a protected checkout.** Every gate here (CI, threads,
> version-bump, review-quorum) trusts the ship PROCESS's execution environment: the tools it
> resolves on `PATH` (`gh`, `git`, `jq`, `python3`, `review`, `tg-ctl`) and the `ci/ship/ship.sh`
> + `lib/` code it runs. A party who controls that environment — a hostile `PATH`, or a PR
> worktree whose own `ci/ship/ship.sh` is executed — can weaken any gate, not just the hatch.
> So `gh ship` is meant to run from the **orchestrator's canonical/main checkout**, never from an
> untrusted PR worktree. Within that trust model the review-quorum bypass is closed: nothing the
> PR contents or the `RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM` value carries can forge approval — the
> lib loads by fixed file path under `python3 -I`, tg-ctl resolves off the OS-identity home, and
> approval requires the helper's explicit stdout sentinel (a benign/broken `python3` fails closed).

## All project coupling is OPTIONAL (env knobs)

Nothing org-/tracker-/layout-specific is hard-coded. Configure via env:

| Env | Default | Purpose |
| --- | ------- | ------- |
| `SHIP_DEFAULT_BRANCH` | `main` | Base branch. |
| `SHIP_MERGE_METHOD` | `squash` | `squash` / `merge` / `rebase`. |
| `SHIP_CI_WAIT` | `900` | Max seconds to WATCH pending CI to completion before giving up. |
| `SHIP_CI_POLL` | `20` | Poll interval (seconds) while watching pending CI. |
| `SHIP_CI_GRACE` | `45` | Grace window for checks to *register* on a fresh PR before concluding "no CI" (an empty rollup is briefly normal right after opening a PR). |
| `SHIP_FLAKE_LOOKBACK_RUNS` | `5` | For the `--known-flake` gate: how many recent COMPLETED runs of the same workflow on the base branch to search for a matching failure. A match in any of them is enough. |
| `SHIP_MAIN_CHECKOUT` | first worktree | Where to fast-forward after merge. |
| `SHIP_UI_PATH_REGEX` | common FE paths | What makes a PR "UI-touching". **Set empty to disable the screenshot gate.** |
| `SHIP_IMAGE_UPLOAD_CMD` | (unset) | Optional uploader for `--screenshot`: a command that takes the image (`{FILE}` token or `$1`) and prints a public URL. Without it, `--screenshot` just embeds a local-path note. |
| `SHIP_SKIP_VERSION_BUMP` | (unset) | `=1` overrides the version-bump gate (env equivalent of `--no-version-bump-ok`). |
| `SHIP_AUTO_BUMP` | enabled | `=0` opts out of the merge-time version auto-bump (#518) — the version-bump gate then refuses as before. Also settable per repo as `SHIP_AUTO_BUMP=0` in the committed `.ship-config` (env wins). |
| `SHIP_AUTO_BUMP_HEAD_WAIT` / `SHIP_AUTO_BUMP_HEAD_POLL` | `90` / `3` | Seconds to wait / poll interval for the PR head to reflect ship's own bump commit (and the async update-branch merge) before the CI gate reads its rollup. |
| `SHIP_AUTO_BUMP_CI_GRACE` | `120` | Minimum check-registration grace (overrides a smaller `SHIP_CI_GRACE`) when the green-CI gate waits on the freshly pushed bump commit, so an empty rollup is not misread as a CI outage while Actions enqueues. |
| `SHIP_VERSION_FILES` | auto-detect | Space-separated version files to check (relative to repo root). Default: `pyproject.toml` then `package.json` at the root. Set for a non-standard layout. |
| `SHIP_REVIEW_DWELL` | `600` | Minimum seconds since the PR's last code push before a merge is allowed, so async review has time to **form** its comments. `0` disables the gate. |
| `SHIP_EXTERNAL_REVIEW_ENABLED` / `SHIP_EXTERNAL_REVIEW` | enabled | Set either to `0` to disable the external-review gate entirely (ops off-switch) — refuses a merge when `gh pr view --json reviews` is empty. |
| `RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_SHIP_EXTERNAL_REVIEW` | (unset) | One-time bypass request for the external-review gate, same shape/hardening as `RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM` — see `ci/ship/external_review_hatch.py`. |
| `SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM` / `SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM_ENABLED` | enabled | Set either to `0` to disable the review-quorum gate (Guard-B) entirely (ops off-switch). |
| `SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM_MIN_ITER` | `3` | Quorum floor: PASSED review-cli iterations for the task. **Clamped to a hard minimum of 3** — this knob can only RAISE the bar, never lower it (an unset / `0` / negative / below-3 value resolves to 3, fail-closed #242). |
| `SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM_MIN_ROLES` | `3` | Quorum floor: distinct **BOARD ROLES** across those PASSED iterations. **Clamped to a hard minimum of 3**, same as `MIN_ITER`. This is the **PRIMARY/default gate mechanism** — always enforced, matching review-cli's own default (review-cli#246). |
| `SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM_MIN_MODELS` | `3` if set, else unenforced | Quorum floor: distinct models across those PASSED iterations. **Only takes effect if you explicitly set this env var** — there is no default model floor any more (role-based coverage is the default); `3` is merely the clamp floor the value resolves to once you opt in, same as `MIN_ITER`. Setting it to ANY value — including `0` or blank — counts as opting in and is clamped up to 3 (never treated as "explicitly disabled"; only leaving the var **completely unset** skips the model floor). When set, ship also passes `--min-models` to review-cli, so BOTH floors are required together (mirrors review-cli's own explicit-vs-default AND logic, review-cli#246). |
| `REVIEW_TASK_CODE` | (auto) | The PR's task code for the quorum gate. Unset → derived from a `HYP-<n>`/uppercase ticket token, then a purely descriptive ALL-CAPS/hyphenated code (`SME-ROADMAP-WORKTREE-NOTE`-shaped, 3+ segments, no digits), then — last — a keyword-anchored GitHub issue reference (`Fixes #105`/`Refs #105` → literal `#105`; two distinct anchored refs are ambiguous and derive nothing), tried against the branch name then the PR body; none found → fail-closed refuse. |
| `RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM` | (unset) | One-time bypass request for a not-met quorum bar: set to a written justification to ask Alex live on Telegram (shared `agenttools_hatch_escalation` lib); proceeds ONLY on his real-time approval. Under `--dry-run`, the helper reports the would-be request but does not contact `tg-ctl` or write a bypass audit line. Blank/bare values denied. **No self-service reason flag exists.** The lib is imported from a fixed path relative to `ship.sh`, and tg-ctl is resolved from a rig.yaml in the OS account's **real home** (`pwd.getpwuid` — **not** the `$HOME` env var, **not** the PR's repo) then a trusted-paths allowlist. So neither an env var (including a doctored `HOME`) nor a rig.yaml the PR commits can redirect approval to a stub. |
| `SHIP_ACCEPTANCE_GATE` | enabled | Set to `0` to disable the pre-merge acceptance gate (`task gate`) — ops off-switch, also accepted as a committed `.ship-config` line. The per-ticket opt-out is `task change <code> --post-merge-acceptance "<reason>"`, not this. |
| `SHIP_MAGIC_CLOSE_GATE` | enabled | Set to `0` to disable the magic-close keyword gate. |
| `SHIP_AUDIT_FILE` | `~/.config/agent-tools/ship-audit.jsonl` | JSONL audit log; one line per non-dry-run gated ship. Review-quorum decisions: `authorized` / `bypass:approved` / `bypass:denied` / `refused` (with a `task_code`, plus `roles`/`min_roles`/`models`/`min_models` — `min_models` is `0` when the model floor was NOT enforced for that decision, since a genuinely enforced floor is always clamped to >=3 and can never legitimately be `0`; note the `bypass:approved` line is written by the shared `agenttools_hatch_escalation` lib and does not yet carry the roles/min_models fields — see the code comment at the DENIED-case call site, tracked as agent-tools#414). `--skip-ci` decisions: `skipci:bypass:approved` / `skipci:bypass:denied` / `skipci:refused` (with `gate":"skip-ci"`). External-review decisions: `external-review:refused` / `external-review:bypass:approved` / `external-review:bypass:denied` (with `gate":"external-review"`). `--known-flake` decisions: `confirmed` / `confirmed-local-gate-failed` / `refused` (with `"gate":"known-flake"` and the asserted check names) — `confirmed` is written only after `gh pr merge` actually succeeds, never merely after the claim checks out. Acceptance-gate decisions: `authorized` / `authorized:post-merge-opt-out` / `refused` / `skipped` / `auto-closed` / `auto-close-failed` (with `"gate":"acceptance"`, a `task_code` when one was derived, and a `detail` — the opt-out reason, `criteria=3 unchecked=3 proofless=2`, or why it was skipped; `auto-closed`/`auto-close-failed` are the post-merge `task done <code>` this gate also runs when everything was already proven — see "Auto-close" below). Magic-close decisions: `refused` / `rewritten` (with `"gate":"magic-close"` and the matched phrases in `detail`, `;`-joined). |

### Migrating to the role-based default (review-cli#246)

The review-quorum gate's primary/default check switched from counting distinct **models** to
counting distinct **BOARD ROLES**. This has TWO distinct migration consequences, in opposite
directions — an unexpected refusal for some tasks, and a silently WEAKENED default guarantee for
every deployment that never touches `SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM_MIN_MODELS`:

- **A deployment that relied on the old default is now weaker without any action, or any warning
  at merge time.** Before, the default required 3 distinct **models** — a real independence
  signal (no single reviewer, human or AI, could clear the bar alone). Now the default requires
  3 distinct **roles**, which ONE model reviewing under three role hats (backend/security/
  architecture) can satisfy on its own, with no model-diversity floor unless you explicitly set
  `SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM_MIN_MODELS`. If your deployment's threat model depends on multi-model
  independence, set that env var explicitly — the new default does not provide it any more.
- **An installed `review` (review-cli) build that predates role support** can cause an
  unexpected refusal. ship detects this and refuses with an explicit "the installed review-cli
  does not support `--min-roles`... upgrade it" hint (never a hollow "could not query"). Remedy:
  upgrade review-cli.
- **A task whose PASSED review history was recorded before role tagging existed** (or came from a
  mode with no role concept, e.g. `quorum`/`just-ask`/`brainstorm`) can also cause an unexpected
  refusal. Even a fully modern review-cli reads 0 roles for that history and refuses. Remedy: run
  a fresh `review diff --task <code>` (the review-diff/visual board dispatch is what records
  per-seat roles) so the task accrues real role-tagged iterations, then re-run ship.

If you're mid-migration and genuinely need to merge now, the one-time
`RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM` Telegram hatch (see below) is the intended relief valve —
prefer it over `SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM=0`, which disables the ENTIRE gate (iteration and any explicit
model floor too), not just the role requirement.

## Flags

- `--skip-ci` — admin-merge bypassing the green-CI gate (+ branch protection); the other
  preflights still run. **Deny-by-default**: it proceeds ONLY on a one-time live Telegram approval
  requested via `RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_SHIP_SKIP_CI="<justification>"` (same shared hatch lib as the
  review-quorum gate; a blank/bare value is denied; no ops off-switch). This is **not** the way to
  handle billing-blocked/stuck CI — for that, run **without** `--skip-ci`: the normal path
  auto-detects the outage, runs the local fallback gate, and does a normal (non-admin) merge.
- `--dry-run` — print, change nothing.
- `--no-screenshot-ok <reason>` — override the UI screenshot requirement, logged.
- `--no-version-bump-ok <reason>` — override the version-bump requirement for a genuine
  no-release ship (docs-only, pure test/CI, a revert), logged.
- `--no-review-dwell-ok <reason>` — fast-track past the review-dwell window for a genuine
  trivial/urgent merge, logged (the reason is printed to the ship log).
- `--resolve-addressed-threads` (or `SHIP_RESOLVE_ADDRESSED_THREADS=1`) — before the
  unresolved-threads gate, auto-resolve the review threads that are **safe to close without a
  human**: unresolved **and** `isOutdated` (the code the thread anchored to has changed — a later
  commit addressed it) **and** authored **entirely** by automated reviewers (login ends in
  `[bot]`, or `chatgpt-codex-connector` / `codex-review-bot`). A thread with **any** human comment,
  or one that is still current (not addressed), is **never** touched — it falls through and still
  blocks the merge. This lets a shipping agent close its own bot nits through `gh ship` instead of
  hand-running the `resolveReviewThread` mutation (which the `block-raw-pr-merge` agent-hook used to
  false-block, #268). Off by default; honours `--dry-run` (reports what it would resolve, mutates
  nothing). A bot thread with **more than 100 comments** is fail-closed (never auto-resolved, since a
  human reply could hide on an unfetched page) and must be resolved by hand. **Caveat:** `isOutdated`
  only means the anchored code *changed* since the comment (a heuristic that the nit was addressed) —
  **not** a verified fix. A still-valid bot finding on rewritten/rebased code can therefore be
  auto-closed; use the flag only when you trust the bot threads are genuinely addressed. A
  severity-aware gate (never auto-close a P0/P1/security bot thread) is a tracked follow-up.
- `--rewrite-magic-close` — when the magic-close gate finds `Closes/Fixes/Resolves <ref>` in the
  PR title or body, rewrite the keyword(s) to `Refs` via `gh pr edit` (audited, `rewritten`) and
  continue instead of refusing. Only the field that matched is edited; the rest of the text is
  untouched. Under `--dry-run` the edit is printed, not made.
- `--screenshot <path> [desc]` — upload (via `SHIP_IMAGE_UPLOAD_CMD`) and post a screenshot
  as a PR comment; repeatable.
- `--known-flake <check-name>` — assert that the FAILED check named `<check-name>` (exactly as
  printed by the green-CI gate's own `x <name> -> <conclusion>` refusal lines) is a pre-existing
  failure unrelated to this diff, not the "CI is structurally down" case above. Repeatable — one
  per currently-failing check. **Not a blind trust-me flag**: ship independently verifies the
  claim against the base branch's own recent CI history before doing anything with it (see the
  table row above); an unverifiable assertion is refused, same as not passing the flag. On
  success, runs the local fallback gate and merges only if it's green too. Logged to
  `SHIP_AUDIT_FILE`.

The **review-quorum gate (Guard-B) has no override flag** by design — a bypass goes through live
Telegram approval to Alex via `RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM="<justification>"` (see the env
table above), never a self-service reason. The hatch imports the shared `agenttools_hatch_escalation`
lib from `lib/` **relative to `ship.sh`'s location in the checkout**, so run `ship` from within the
agent-tools checkout (or via `gh ship` pointed at it) to use the hatch. A bare `cp ci/ship/ship.sh
~/bin/ship` copy can still *enforce* the gate but can't reach the lib, so a bypass request from a
detached copy **fails closed** (refuses) — that's intentional, not a bug.

## The acceptance gate's contract with task-cli (`task gate <code> --json`)

Kept byte-for-byte identical on both ends — this section and task-cli's README "The pre-merge
gate" describe the same thing; a change is a two-repo change.

```
task gate <code>            # exit 0 = accepted; 1 = NOT accepted; 2 = could not evaluate
task gate <code> --json     # exit 0 and 1 print one JSON object; exit 2 prints `error: …` (not JSON)
```

```json
{
  "id": "HYP-1440", "ok": false, "state": "done", "gate_enabled": true,
  "post_merge_acceptance": null,          // or the recorded opt-out reason (string)
  "criteria": 3,                          // total count; 0 => refused (nothing to accept)
  "below_minimum": false,                 // true when criteria < this repo's acceptance_min, not skipped
  "unchecked": [{"index": 3, "text": "survives a restart"}],
  "proofless": [{"index": 2, "text": "handles the empty case"}]   // checked without a proof/force reason
}
```

- **The verdict is the exit code.** Ship never re-derives it from the JSON, so a jq-less
  machine still gates correctly; the JSON only shapes the refusal message and the audit `detail`.
- Exit 0 covers: every criterion checked with a proof (or a `--force` reason) AND at least the
  configured minimum count; a recorded `post_merge_acceptance` (ship prints the reason and writes
  `authorized:post-merge-opt-out`); the gate disabled in that repo's task config
  (`gate_enabled: false`); a cancelled ticket.
- Exit 1 covers: any `unchecked` or `proofless` criterion, `criteria: 0`, or `below_minimum:
  true`. **`below_minimum` can be true with BOTH `unchecked` and `proofless` EMPTY** — a ticket
  below its configured minimum (e.g. one fully-proven criterion, minimum two) refuses on count
  alone, not on any specific criterion's proof — ship's own refusal message checks this field,
  and any other consumer must too, or a refusal like this prints with nothing listed under it.
  `index` is the 1-based position in the full criteria list — the number `task check <code> <n>`
  takes. `unchecked`/`proofless` are always populated, even on a passing opt-out, so the shipper
  sees what is still owed after the merge.
- Exit 2 (unknown id, backend error) is a logged skip on ship's side — not evidence either way.
- Ship's own knobs: `SHIP_ACCEPTANCE_GATE=0` (env or committed `.ship-config`) disables the
  gate; there is no reason flag — the opt-out lives ON the ticket, where `task done` and an
  auditor can see it.

The code derivation is `_ship_derive_task_code_for_notify` (branch name → PR title → PR body,
each candidate validated to contain a digit) — the same function the post-merge
`task mark-shipped` notify uses, so the ticket ship gates on is the ticket it later marks shipped.

### Auto-close: the merge itself finishes the ticket when nothing is left to prove

A gate that only REFUSES a bad merge does not by itself close the gap it exists for: tg-cli#301
shipped for real via PR #305 (every criterion independently verified against the merged code)
yet sat OPEN for days, because closing it needed a separate `task done` nobody remembered to run
after the merge. So when the pre-merge acceptance gate finds every criterion **already** checked
with a proof — a genuine pass, never the post-merge opt-out, where acceptance is deliberately not
yet true — the post-merge notify step also runs `task done <code>` right there, immediately after
`task mark-shipped`. There is nothing left to prove at that point; `task done` is a formality
task-cli should be asked to do, not a step left for a human to remember.

Best-effort, like the rest of the notify step: `task done` still enforces every OTHER close gate
(formatting, links, screenshots, msgref, …), so a genuine refusal there is expected sometimes and
only ever WARNS with the manual fallback (`task done <code>`) — it never fails the ship (the merge
already succeeded and is durable). Runs only when `SHIP_TASK_NOTIFY_ENABLED` reaches that far (the
same switch as the notify step) and the acceptance gate genuinely ran and passed for THIS PR's own
derived code — a gate that was skipped, disabled, refused (unreachable — ship would already have
exited), or passed only via the opt-out never triggers an auto-close. "Genuinely passed" is
narrower than a bare `ok: true`: the JSON's `post_merge_acceptance` must be `null`,
`gate_enabled` must not be `false`, and `state` must be neither of task-cli's two terminal
states, `"cancelled"` or `"done"` — an already-cancelled or already-done ticket (e.g. a
follow-up PR that references a ticket an EARLIER merge already closed), or one whose
`acceptance_checked` gate is disabled for this repo, also exits 0, but none of those have
"nothing left to prove" in the sense that makes an automatic `task done` sensible; without `jq`
(so that distinction can't be verified from the JSON at all) auto-close never fires either.
stdout and stderr from `task gate` are captured SEPARATELY — any diagnostic line task-cli
writes to stderr is logged on its own, never mixed into the text `jq` parses as JSON. Audited
to `SHIP_AUDIT_FILE` as a THIRD acceptance-gate decision alongside `authorized`/`refused`/`skipped`: `auto-closed` /
`auto-close-failed`.

## What was stripped vs an internal version

This is generalized from a real in-house ship script. Removed/parameterized: any issue-
tracker coupling (ticket-id extraction, attaching proof to a tracker — replaced by the
generic `SHIP_IMAGE_UPLOAD_CMD` hook), hard-coded front-end path layout (now
`SHIP_UI_PATH_REGEX`), and any org/branch assumptions (now `SHIP_DEFAULT_BRANCH`). If you
want tracker integration back, set `SHIP_IMAGE_UPLOAD_CMD` to your tracker's attach command.

## When to use

When you merge PRs from the CLI and want the merge to be impossible unless the PR is green,
its threads resolved, a review-dwell window elapsed (so review questions had time to form),
(for UI) its screenshot present, its ticket accepted with proofs, and no magic-close keyword
waiting to close that ticket behind the gates — without trusting yourself to remember. The CI
workflows in this directory are the server-side backstop; `ship` is the client-side gate.
