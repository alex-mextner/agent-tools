# AGENTS.md — agent-tools

This repo is the portable **rule/guard catalog** for AI-assisted development — a library of
skills, agent-hooks, git-hooks, CI gates, and MCP slots, distilled from practice and
generalized so they apply to *any* project, language, or harness. It is **not** an installer
and has **no runtime of its own**: the directories here are *content*, consumed through one
front door — [`rig`](https://github.com/alex-mextner/rig-cli) (the separate `rig-cli` repo) —
which reads a committed `rig.yaml` and wires the catalog into two distinct targets at once:

- **a repo** — via committed artifacts: git-hooks (or the global dispatcher), CI workflows in
  `.github/workflows/`, MCP registrations, and the `rig.yaml` itself.
- **a dev machine / agent harness** — via the machine layer: skills dropped into the harness's
  skills dir, agent-hooks installed into its hook dir, the global git-hook dispatcher, the
  model-freshness cron.

The same catalog feeds both. A `skills/universal/*` entry lands in your harness; a `ci/<slot>/`
workflow lands in a repo's `.github/`. agent-tools is the **what**; `rig` is the **how** — and
`rig` lives in another repo, so nothing in *this* tree imports or runs `rig`.

The single most important thing for an agent landing here: **you are editing a content
catalog, not an application.** There is no `main()`, no entry point, no `bin/rig` in this
repo. The "behavior" is what `rig` does *with* these files elsewhere. Keep that frame and the
rest of this doc makes sense.

## Orchestration doctrine: the main agent only orchestrates

The main/orchestrator agent **only orchestrates**: it **PLANS**, **DISPATCHES** work to
subagents/workflows, and **VERIFIES** results. It does **not** implement inline. **All**
implementation work — fixes, features, builds, investigations, migrations — runs in
**subagent swarms** (the `Agent` tool or a Workflow), never in the main thread. Fan out
broadly and in **parallel**, grouped **by repo** (one shipping agent per repo at a time) to
avoid worktree/ship collisions, and parallel **across** repos. Each dispatched agent carries
the full discipline: **ticket → fresh worktree → tests → review-gate (`[ok]`) → `gh ship`**.
The orchestrator **verifies every "done"** — PR merged **and** CI green, never trusting a
subagent's "all green" on its own word — and marks a roadmap item done only after it is
verified **and** the CTO has confirmed it's OK. This is enforced mechanically by the
`orchestrator-stays-thin` agent-hook, which blocks the main agent's implementation-shaped
Bash/Edit/Write while exempting subagents (see [Agent-hooks](#agent-hooks-the-agents-own-mid-session-gates)
below). The hook is the mechanism; this section is the intent.

## How the catalog is discovered: directory convention, zero registration

There is no central registry, manifest, or index file you edit to "add" a catalog item.
`rig` scans this tree live and an item *is* a directory at a known path. **Drop a directory
in the right place and it becomes a catalog item** — that is the whole registration story.

| Carrier | Convention | What a new directory must contain |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Skill | `skills/universal/<name>/SKILL.md`, `skills/by-type/<group>/<name>/SKILL.md`, or `skills/by-stack/<l1>/<lang>[/<framework>]/<name>/SKILL.md` | one `SKILL.md` with `name` + `description` frontmatter (the trigger), the portable rule, rationale, a generic example |
| Agent-hook | `agent-hooks/<name>/` | a `<id>.<point>.json` descriptor + the executable it points at + `README.md` |
| CI gate | `ci/<slot>/` | a `README.md` + either a `workflow.yml` (most slots) or a shell script (a client-side gate like `ci/ship/ship.sh`, which is a merge command, not a GitHub workflow) |
| Git-hook | `git-hooks/<hook>` (`pre-commit`, `commit-msg`, `pre-push`, `no-secrets-scan`, `lefthook.yml`, `global-dispatcher/`) | the copyable hook script |
| MCP slot | `mcp/<name>/` | the slot's config + `README.md` (see the MCP-vs-CLI policy first — the default is *don't add one*) |
| Lib module | `lib/<module>/` | an importable Python package (often its own `pyproject.toml` — see below) |

The `<group>` axis for by-type skills is fixed:
`bot`, `backend`, `frontend`, `cli`, `library`, `infra`, `monorepo`. A skill that applies to
*every* project goes in `universal/`; one scoped to a project shape goes under its `by-type/`
group.

The **third axis is `by-stack/`** — the stack-preset curation axis. Its path IS the stack
path: `by-stack/<l1>/<lang>[/<framework>]/<name>/SKILL.md` (minimum depth `<l1>/<lang>`; a
skill placed directly under `<l1>` with no `<lang>` is ignored). A repo declares a stack (e.g.
`mobile/swift/swiftui`) and inherits every by-stack skill whose stack path is a **prefix** of
it — so a lang-level skill at `frontend/ts/` is inherited by every `frontend/ts/*` stack, and a
framework-level skill at `frontend/ts/react/` only by React repos. Place a skill at the *shallowest*
prefix that honestly applies, and keep its `description` scope no broader than that prefix (a skill
under `frontend/ts` must not claim to cover backend TS — a `backend/ts` stack never inherits it).
`by-type/` and `by-stack/` are complementary: `by-type` selects by project *shape*, `by-stack`
by declared tech *stack*.

**Non-obvious:** because discovery is by location, the catalog grows with **no code change in
`rig`**. You add a directory here, the consumer re-runs `rig apply` in their repo, and the new
item flows in. Conversely, *moving or renaming* a directory is a breaking change to its
identity — a skill's path, a hook's `<id>.<point>.json` name, and a CI slot's directory name
are the stable handles `rig.yaml` and the harness key on.

---

## The declarative / reconcile model (it lives in `rig`, acts on this catalog)

`rig` treats your repo + machine like Terraform treats infra: `rig status` computes the
**two-way drift** between what `rig.yaml` declares and what is actually on disk; `rig apply`
**reconciles** — it builds the set of intended actions, diffs against current state, and
applies only the delta (idempotent; backs up on conflict). The plan/drift/reconcile *engine*
(the `_build_*` action emitters and `_do_<kind>` handlers) is **in `rig-cli`, not in this
repo** — so do not go looking for `plan.py` / `drift.py` / `runner.py` here. What you control
from *this* repo is the catalog the engine reconciles toward.

Practical consequence for an agent: you never "install" a skill or a hook by hand in a
consumer repo. You add/edit content here, and the declarative pass in `rig` converges the
target. If a change isn't showing up, the question is "did `rig apply` run against an enabled
item in `rig.yaml`?" — not "did I copy the file to the right place?".

---

## Agent-hooks: the agent's OWN mid-session gates

Agent-hooks are the non-obvious bit of this repo. They are **not** git hooks and **not** CI.
They are out-of-process guards that intercept *the agent's own tool calls* — a Bash command, a
file write, the end of a turn — **before the side effect happens**, and can deny it. A git hook
fires too late (at commit); a CI check fires far too late (after push). Only an agent-hook can
stop a `--no-verify` commit (the very thing being skipped) or stop a secret from being written
to a file in the first place.

The contract is `agents-hooks/v1`: a descriptor (`{id, point, cmd (ABSOLUTE), priority,
timeout_ms, on_error}`) names an executable that reads a JSON event on stdin and signals via
exit code — **`0` allow · `10` BLOCK (canonical even if stdout is malformed) · any other →
the descriptor's `on_error` policy** (`open` = warn-and-proceed, `closed` = deny on failure).
`cmd` must be absolute; installers (i.e. `rig`) substitute the real path for the shipped
`/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/...` placeholder.

The shipped hooks and their points:

| Point | Hooks |
| --- | --- |
| `pre-agent` **(live in CC and opencode once rig registers their matchers; NOT mapped in Codex yet)** | `background-subagent-gate` (orchestration doctrine: block a non-trivial FOREGROUND subagent dispatch; subagent-exempt) |
| `pre-bash` | `block-no-verify` (fail-closed), `block-raw-pr-merge`, `block-reset-hard` (fail-closed: blocks `git reset --hard` and `git clean -f...`/`-fd`/`-fdx` — irreversible working-tree wipes with no undo; deny-by-default, no self-service bypass — an optional repo-owner `agent_hooks.approval_cmd` in rig.yaml is the only override, Alex tg#6554), `pkill-guard` (fail-closed: blocks a PATTERN-based kill — `pkill -f`/`killall`/`kill $(pgrep ...)`/`pgrep | xargs kill` — of a shared/ambiguous process name like `node`/`codex`/`review diff`; allows `kill <pid>` and any session-scoped pattern; deny-by-default, `RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_PKILL_GUARD` Telegram hatch only; retrospective gap G-5), `pin-primary-worktree` (per-repo `worktree_only` opt-in: blocks a `git checkout`/`switch` that would move the repo's PRIMARY worktree off its default branch — the pre-bash complement to `worktree-only-writes` below; deny-by-default, `RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_PIN_PRIMARY_WORKTREE` Telegram hatch only), `block-devserver-primary` (same `worktree_only` opt-in: blocks launching a dev server / dev-watch process — `npm run dev`, `vite`, `next dev`, ... — while the effective cwd sits on an enrolled repo's default branch; a dev server's own writes bypass Edit/Write entirely, so this is the Bash-launch counterpart neither `worktree-only-writes` nor `pin-primary-worktree` can see; deny-by-default, `RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_BLOCK_DEVSERVER_PRIMARY` Telegram hatch only), `require-review-before-commit`, `require-ticket-before-commit`, `enforce-timeout-on-bash`, `orchestrator-stays-thin` (impl-bash, warn→block, subagent-exempt), `no-long-inline-process` (review/--watch/build-test/long-sleep, subagent-exempt), `subagent-no-bg-longproc` (the INVERSE: block a SUBAGENT from BACKGROUNDING a long process — `run_in_background:true`/`&`/`setsid` on review/--watch/build-test/long-sleep — since a subagent is never re-invoked by a background-completion notification and would wedge forever; subagent-ONLY), `no-shell-file-edit` (block `sed -i`/`perl -i`/`gawk -i inplace` or a `> file` redirect editing a tracked source file; parsed not raw-matched; NOT subagent-exempt), `skills-read-gate` (mandatory skills before work, warn→block), `visual-proof-gate` (block a UI commit with no looked-at screenshot), `decision-request-format` (ADVISORY, never blocks: on a `tg --tag decision` send, self-check the body for Context/Options/Recommendation per the `decision-request-discipline` skill; parsed not raw-matched; NOT subagent-exempt) |
| `pre-write` | `block-secrets-write`, `block-raw-process-env`, `orchestrator-stays-thin` (non-docs code Edit/Write, warn→block, subagent-exempt), `worktree-only-writes` (per-repo `worktree_only` opt-in: blocks an Edit/Write while the checkout sits on the repo's default branch, redirecting to a separate worktree; deny-by-default, `RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_WORKTREE_ONLY_WRITES` Telegram hatch only) |
| `pre-skill` **(live in CC once rig registers the `Skill` matcher; NOT mapped in Codex/opencode yet)** | `skills-marker-writer` (touches the freshness marker `skills-read-gate` reads — ADVISORY, never blocks) |
| `post-write` | `format-on-write`, `lint-on-write` (react to the completed write; exit-10 is feedback because the write already landed) |
| `stop` | `stop-completion-selfcheck` |

**The carrier trap (`lib/cc_hook_bridge`, `lib/codex_hook_bridge`).** Harnesses do **not**
run these descriptors directly; they only run hooks declared in their own config. The bridge
dispatchers are the carriers that make installed descriptors fire. The dispatcher itself is
fail-**open** at the top level (a broken bridge must never wedge every tool call), while an
individual fail-closed hook still blocks through the shared `agents-hooks/v1` runner.

**Claude Code:** `lib/cc_hook_bridge` is wired by `rig` into `settings.json`. It maps
`PreToolUse` → `pre-bash`/`pre-write`/`pre-agent`/`pre-skill` (the third for the `Agent`/
`Task` subagent tools, the fourth for the `Skill` tool), `PostToolUse` file-edit tools →
`post-write`, and `Stop` → `stop`; it translates exit-10 BLOCK into CC's
`permissionDecision: "deny"` / `decision: "block"`. The bridge also forwards CC's
`agent_id`/`agent_type` (present only inside a dispatched subagent) into the v1 event, so a
subagent-exempt gate can tell a subagent's own tool use apart from the orchestrator's.
**Two-repo split, both halves required:** the point mapping (which CC `(event, tool)` maps
to which logical point) lives here; the matcher that makes CC actually *fire* that event —
an `Agent|Task` or `Skill` `PreToolUse` matcher in `settings.json`'s `hook_bridge_entries` —
is registered by the separate rig-cli repo. Either half alone is inert; `pre-agent` and
`pre-skill` are both live only once BOTH sides have shipped and `rig apply` has run.

**Codex:** `lib/codex_hook_bridge` is the first bridge for the confirmed Codex hooks
contract. Codex TOML hooks call it for `PreToolUse` `Bash` (`pre-bash`), `PreToolUse`
`apply_patch` (`pre-write`), `PostToolUse` `apply_patch` (`post-write` feedback), and `Stop`
(`stop`), reading descriptors from `~/.codex/hooks` and emitting Codex's plain
`{"decision":"block","reason":"..."}` shape. It deliberately does **not** map Codex
`SubagentStart`/`SubagentStop` to `pre-agent` yet; that needs a trustworthy captured payload
fixture before this catalog can safely enforce subagent dispatch semantics.

**The "runs before the command" trap.** `pre-bash` hooks run *before* the command they gate,
so the precondition they check must already be satisfied. The clearest example is
`require-review-before-commit`: it allows `git commit` only if a **review marker file is
fresh** — it stats `REVIEW_MARKER` (default `~/.cache/agent-tools/last-review`) and passes
only when its mtime is within `REVIEW_FRESH_WINDOW_S` (3600s) of now. So the workflow is two
steps: **run the review and refresh the marker first, *then* `git commit`.** Committing first
and reviewing after does not work — the gate has already fired. (This hook is `on_error: open`
— a discipline reminder, not a security boundary; contrast `block-no-verify`, fail-closed.)

## The ship gate: the only sanctioned merge

A raw `gh pr merge` is **not** how work lands here — `block-raw-pr-merge` exists to stop it
mid-session. The sanctioned path is **`gh ship <PR>`** (which calls
[`ci/ship/ship.sh`](ci/ship/ship.sh)). Before it merges, `ship` refuses unless:

- the PR is OPEN, not CONFLICTING, not BEHIND its base;
- **every reported CI check's LATEST run is green** — it polls the PR's `statusCheckRollup`,
  collapses it to the latest run per logical check (keyed by check type + workflow + provider +
  name/context, matching how GitHub computes `mergeStateStatus`, so a stale FAILURE from a
  re-run that has since gone green does not block), and treats any check whose latest run isn't
  SUCCESS/SKIPPED/NEUTRAL as a failure. *All* reported checks gate the merge, not only the
  branch-ruleset's required ones (an optional/advisory check whose latest run is red still blocks
  `gh ship`). And *no CI at all is itself a failed gate*, not a free pass — it watches pending
  checks to completion, then gates on the result. **Exception — a genuine CI outage:** if the
  rollup is empty because a `pull_request`-triggered workflow exists on the PR's pushed base
  branch (`origin/<baseRefName>`) but registered no check (billing suspended / Actions down),
  ship runs the local fallback gate (tests + leftover scan + PR checklist + review threads) and,
  only if it is fully green, falls through to the normal non-admin merge (branch protection still
  gates it — no silent `--admin`-bypass); a repo whose workflows never trigger on PRs stays a
  hard refuse (see `ci/ship/README.md` for the trigger-detection heuristic and its residuals);
- there are **no unresolved review threads** — pass `--resolve-addressed-threads` (or
  `SHIP_RESOLVE_ADDRESSED_THREADS=1`) to let ship first auto-close the threads that are safe without
  a human (unresolved + outdated = addressed by a later commit + authored entirely by bots); a human
  or still-unaddressed thread is never touched and still blocks (#268);
- the PR has **at least one GitHub-side review** — `gh pr view --json reviews` must be
  non-empty (any state, any author; existence is the signal, not the verdict). Closes a gap
  the unresolved-threads check above cannot: zero reviews means zero threads, which is
  vacuously "clean". Real incident: hyperide/hyper-saas PR #764 merged with zero reviews on
  Guard-B alone. Disable with `SHIP_EXTERNAL_REVIEW_ENABLED=0` (or the shorter
  `SHIP_EXTERNAL_REVIEW=0`); no self-service override — a one-time bypass is
  `RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_SHIP_EXTERNAL_REVIEW="<justification>"` (same shared hatch lib as
  `--skip-ci`/review-quorum; see `ci/ship/external_review_hatch.py`);
- a UI-touching PR carries an embedded **screenshot** (override with `--no-screenshot-ok
  <reason>`);
- a PR that changes **shippable source** (not docs/test/CI) has **bumped the declared
  version** (`pyproject.toml` `version` / `package.json` `"version"`) vs the PR base — a ship
  of source is a release, so `--version` stays a real freshness signal instead of a stale
  literal (skill: `bump-version-on-release`) — and **by default ship makes that PATCH bump
  itself at merge time** (#518): it commits `chore(release): bump version X -> Y (ship
  auto-bump for #N)` onto the PR head branch through the GitHub Contents API (updating the
  branch from base first when base's version already moved, so parallel PRs never conflict on
  the version line), waits for CI on the new head, measures review-dwell from the last
  non-ship push, auto-resolves a bot thread on the bump line, and audits `version-bump:auto`;
  a PR that already bumps past base (a deliberate minor/major) is left alone; `SHIP_AUTO_BUMP=0`
  (env or the committed `.ship-config`) restores the refuse-until-bumped behaviour; override a
  genuine no-release ship with `--no-version-bump-ok <reason>` or `SHIP_SKIP_VERSION_BUMP=1`;
- the **review-quorum bar is met** (Guard-B of the self-merge-authority program) — the PR's task
  code (`$REVIEW_TASK_CODE`, else a `HYP-<n>`/uppercase ticket token, else a purely descriptive
  ALL-CAPS/hyphenated code (`SME-ROADMAP-WORKTREE-NOTE`-shaped, 3+ segments, no digits) — all
  tried against the branch name or PR
  body) has ≥ `SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM_MIN_ITER` PASSED review-cli iterations across ≥
  `SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM_MIN_ROLES` distinct BOARD ROLES (`review task <code> --check`) — this is
  the DEFAULT check and is always enforced, matching review-cli's own role-based coverage
  (review-cli#246). `SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM_MIN_MODELS` is an OPT-IN extra: unset by default (no
  model floor), and if an operator sets it, both the role floor AND the model floor apply
  together. Both floors, when in force, are **clamped to a hard minimum of 3** — the env knobs
  can only RAISE the bar, never lower it (a `0`/negative/below-3 value resolves to 3). This is
  the gate that makes self-merge *strictly controlled*; it **fails closed** (a missing task
  code / `review` CLI / unreadable store, OR a quorum reading 0 iterations / 0 distinct roles,
  all refuse — ship re-derives the verdict from the counts, never trusts the subprocess's
  `passed` boolean alone, #242). An installed `review-cli` too old to report roles gets an
  explicit "upgrade review-cli" refusal instead of a generic error. There is **NO self-service override flag** — a one-time bypass
  is requested via `RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM="<justification>"`, which asks Alex live
  on Telegram (shared `agenttools_hatch_escalation` lib) and proceeds ONLY on his real-time
  approval. Disable the whole gate with `SHIP_REVIEW_QUORUM=0`. Every non-dry-run gated ship is
  audited to `SHIP_AUDIT_FILE`; dry-runs print the would-be audit without writing it. **Every
  `RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_*` hatch across every agent-hook** (not just ship's own two) is separately
  audited by the shared lib itself: any attempt that REACHES `request_hatch_approval` with the env
  var carrying a value — blank, bare-flag, denied, or approved — appends one JSON line to
  `overrides.log` (default `<real-home>/.config/agent-tools/overrides.log`,
  `default_overrides_log_path()`), closing gap G-8 from the 2026-07-01 agent-ecosystem retrospective
  (`docs/specs/…` in hyperide, section 5.2.3 item 3: "escape hatches have no audit sink"). Two
  pre-existing exceptions, same shape: `ci/ship/skip_ci_hatch.py` (for
  `RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_SHIP_SKIP_CI`) and `ci/ship/external_review_hatch.py` (for
  `RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_SHIP_EXTERNAL_REVIEW`) each deny a blank/bare value LOCALLY (a deliberate,
  lib-version-independent guard, unrelated to this feature) before ever calling the shared lib, so
  that specific blank/bare case is recorded only in `SHIP_AUDIT_FILE` on the non-dry-run path — and
  in NEITHER file on `--dry-run` (the local guard denies without calling `_audit`, and `ship.sh`'s
  own dry-run audit helper prints the would-be line without writing it). Every other outcome
  (denied/approved, and the review-quorum hatch's own blank/bare case) routes through the lib as
  described above. A `rig
  status` "overrides this week" section and a weekly tg digest reading this file are tracked as
  follow-up work, not yet built;
- the local branch has **no unpushed/diverged commits** and a **clean worktree**.

Then it squash-merges, deletes the remote branch, removes the local worktree + branch (unless
you're sitting inside that worktree), and fast-forwards the main checkout. It is
repo-agnostic: nothing about an org/tracker/path layout is hard-coded, and knobs are env-driven
— most notably **`SHIP_MAIN_CHECKOUT`** (the primary checkout to refresh post-merge; defaults
to the first `git worktree list` entry), plus `SHIP_DEFAULT_BRANCH`, `SHIP_MERGE_METHOD`,
`SHIP_UI_PATH_REGEX`, `SHIP_IMAGE_UPLOAD_CMD`. `--skip-ci` admin-merges (still runs the other
preflights) and is **deny-by-default** — it proceeds only on a one-time live Telegram approval via
`RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_SHIP_SKIP_CI="<justification>"`. It is NOT the billing-blocked-CI path: for that,
run without `--skip-ci` (the normal path auto-detects the outage and does a normal non-admin merge).

---

## Client-side vs. server-side enforcement (and why `ship` is not enough)

`ship.sh` and the `block-raw-pr-merge` agent-hook are **client-side** gates: they re-check
green-CI / unresolved-threads / screenshot / version-bump *in the session*, before merging.
They are **bypassable** — a merge from the **GitHub web UI**, a raw `gh pr merge` from an
**uninstrumented shell** (no agent-hooks loaded), or any tool that isn't `gh ship` never runs
them, so nothing is checked. That is not a hypothetical: hyper-saas **#543** squash-merged
through **red CI, an open review thread, and no screenshot** precisely because the client gate
was bypassed and there was **no server-side** enforcement behind it.

**Durable enforcement is server-side**, on the merge button itself: GitHub **branch
protection** with the `tier: block` gate contexts listed as **required status checks**, plus
**require-conversation-resolution**, required reviews, and `enforce_admins`. A `tier: block`
CI workflow alone only goes **red** — it does **not** block the merge until its check is
promoted to *required*. That promotion is a server-side admin action this catalog documents
but cannot itself perform; **rig-cli#5** provisions it from a `github:` block in `rig.yaml`
(required_status_checks derived from the enabled block-tier gates,
`required_conversation_resolution`, `enforce_admins`, required reviews — see the
[Client-side vs. server-side enforcement](README.md#client-side-vs-server-side-enforcement-the-543-gap)
section in the README for the schema/example). The catalog is the **what** (gates + this
policy); the reconciler that flips the server-side switches lives in rig-cli (#5).

The block-tier merge-gate READMEs in [`ci/`](ci/) — `tests`, `review-threads`,
`leftover-grep`, `pr-checklist`, `dependency-review`, `screenshots` — now carry this note: a
`tier: block` workflow is a red light, not a merge block, until it is a **required status
check under server-side branch protection** (the same applies to the security gates —
secret-scan, sast, codeql, trivy, license-policy — when you run them as required).

## The universal skills layer: where mandatory behavior lives (don't restate it here)

`skills/universal/*` are the cross-project skills, and the global `rig` config selects them by
default for every machine via **`skills.universal.all: true`** (default-on: a universal skill
is included unless explicitly disabled). **This is the single source of truth for universal,
always-apply mandatory behavior** — e.g. delegating non-trivial work to subagents and the
visual-proof cycle for any user-visible change. The harness surfaces them through each skill's
own trigger `description` plus the SessionStart blurb; `rig` installs them.

**Deliberately, this AGENTS.md does not list or restate those universal mandates.** Duplicating
a universal mandatory skill into a per-repo `AGENTS.md` pins a stale copy to one repo, hides the
real source, and goes out of date the moment the skill changes. `AGENTS.md` is for
**project-specific** guidance only; universal mandates stay in the universal layer that carries
them to *every* project and user. If you want the catalog of always-apply behavior, read
`skills/universal/` — not this file.

## Other things that surprise an agent here

- **`lib/` modules are separate Python distributions, not one package.** `lib/pyproject.toml`,
  `lib/agenttools_config/`, and `lib/agenttools_retry/` each build/publish independently;
  `agenttools_log` "builds as the `agenttools-log` distribution" and "ships standalone."
  Several are **extracted *from* `rig-cli`** to be shared (e.g. `agenttools_config` is
  generalized from `riglib.config`) — so the dependency direction is `rig-cli` → `lib/`, never
  the reverse. They are **stdlib-only at import time** (heavy deps like PyYAML are lazy) so
  importing one never pulls a toolchain.
- **`rig.yaml` here is REPO-level only.** It declares this repo's own CI gates (currently just
  `ci.items.tests`, tier `block`). The machine-wide installs (skills, agent-hooks, the
  git-hook dispatcher, MCP, harness auto-mode) live in the **global** layer
  (`~/.config/rig/config.yaml`) and are intentionally *not* repeated in the committed file. The
  cascade is by location: global is global, this committed file is the repo and overrides it.
- **The repo dogfoods its own gates on itself.** `.github/workflows/tests.yml` *is* the `ci/tests`
  slot, running `uv run --with pytest pytest tests/` on every PR — and it's the green/red signal
  `gh ship` and the branch ruleset wait on here. The agent-hooks and git-hooks this catalog ships
  are the same ones an agent working in this repo is expected to operate under.
- **The MCP default is "don't add one."** `mcp/` is mostly a *policy*: tools advertise to agents
  as a **CLI + skill**, not an MCP server (an MCP pays a permanent context tax). Add an MCP slot
  only when the agent genuinely can't reach the system from a shell. `review` is a CLI+skill for
  exactly this reason — don't wrap it in MCP.
- **An unused tool / skill / MCP / command is a SIGNAL, not a deletion candidate.** When something
  installed is never invoked, the reflex "prune it" is *wrong* — same root as the dead-code rule.
  "Unused" almost always means **broken, unwired, forgotten, or superseded-but-not-migrated**: a
  capability someone built and never finished routing to its callsites (a registry that points at a
  path the harness doesn't read; a skill the model never gets advertised; a command wired to no
  invoker). Investigate WHY it's unused (`git log -S` the symbol, read the commit that added it,
  check for a missing wiring/registration step), then **FIX or wire it** — or leave it. Deleting
  destroys both the signal and a probably-useful-but-broken capability. This applies to the
  catalog's own skills/hooks AND to a user's installed toolset: never propose pruning a user's
  tools because they "look unused" — find out why they aren't used and fix that.

## Working in this repo

- **Docs are English-only.** Every agent-facing doc — this `AGENTS.md`, any repo-level
  `CLAUDE.md`, every `SKILL.md`, every `README.md` — is English. No Cyrillic, not even in
  examples. These files are read by all agents/subagents.
- **Content over code.** Most changes are markdown (a skill, a README) or a small, self-contained
  hook/CI script. A skill has no runtime; a CI slot is a workflow + README; an agent-hook is a
  descriptor + a stdlib-only script. Keep examples generic and portable — nothing in the catalog
  may assume a specific project, since it ships to all of them.
- **Fresh worktrees, off the origin default branch.** Don't work in the primary checkout (another
  agent may hold it). A fresh worktree bases on `origin/<default branch>`, not your current HEAD —
  verify the base before you start if your work is stacked on unmerged branches.
- **Create worktrees with `rig worktree create <name> --from origin/main`** (rig-cli — the
  explicit `--from` matters: the command defaults to branching off your current `HEAD`, which
  contradicts the "off the origin default branch" rule above if you run it from inside an
  existing feature worktree). It lands the tree at the standardized `<repo>/.worktrees/<name>`
  and, *before* creating it, registers `/.worktrees/` in this **clone's** `.git/info/exclude`
  (shared by every linked worktree of this clone, never committed) — that's why `.worktrees/`
  is intentionally NOT in the committed `.gitignore`: it's a local scratch convention, not
  something every clone should carry. Remove a worktree with **`rig worktree remove <name>`**,
  never by deleting its source files by hand (leaves stale `git worktree` metadata) and never
  with plain `git worktree remove` either — that leaves the branch behind, and a later `rig
  worktree create <same-name>` then fails because the branch already exists; `rig worktree
  remove` deletes both the tree and its branch together.
  - **First time in a clone** (including right after pulling this change, or on a brand new
    clone/CI checkout): the exclude entry doesn't exist yet, so `git status` will show any
    `.worktrees/*` content — pre-existing or hand-made — as untracked. Fix it by running `rig
    worktree create <a-new-name> --from origin/main` once (same `--from` reasoning as above —
    this bootstrap worktree is throwaway, remove it with `rig worktree remove` right after) —
    the registration covers the whole `.worktrees/` directory, not just that one name, so it
    retroactively ignores any existing entries too. (It must be a name that doesn't already
    exist under `.worktrees/`: the command checks `target.exists()` and errors "already exists"
    *before* it reaches the exclude reconcile, so re-running it for an already-created
    worktree's own name does nothing.) The other fix is to append `/.worktrees/` to
    `.git/info/exclude` by hand, no `rig worktree create` involved — run this from the
    **primary checkout**, or resolve the shared path first with `git rev-parse
    --git-common-dir` (inside a *linked* worktree `.git` is a file, not a directory, so a
    literal `.git/info/exclude` path doesn't exist there). Do this before running `git add
    -A`/`git add .` from the primary checkout — otherwise a stray `.worktrees/*` entry can get
    staged as a broken gitlink (or, if a worktree's own `.git` file is missing, as plain files).
- **The gates apply to you too.** Atomic, conventional commits (one logical change each); review
  before each commit (refresh the marker, *then* commit); never `--no-verify`; land only via the
  ship gate. These are the same guards this catalog installs for any repo — here they're
  dogfooded.

See [`README.md`](README.md) for the full catalog reference, inventory, and the carrier-decision
guide ([`docs/carrier-decision-guide.md`](docs/carrier-decision-guide.md): skill vs. agent-hook
vs. git-hook).

## Review-thread resolution authority

A shipping agent **may** autonomously resolve a review thread on a PR it created when ALL
four conditions hold:

1. **Quorum review passed**: `review diff` (or `review quorum`) produced an `[ok]` marker for
   the current diff — multi-model consensus cleared.
2. **Finding is P2 / advisory / suggestion / nit** — explicitly NOT P0, P1, critical, or
   security-tagged.
3. **Commenter is an automated bot and no human replied** — the original commenter's
   `author.login` ends in `[bot]` OR is a known automated reviewer (`chatgpt-codex-connector`,
   `codex-review-bot`), AND every other comment in the thread also passes this check. If any
   human commented anywhere in the thread, CTO instruction is required.
4. **The PR was created by the agent in this session** — not resolving threads on someone
   else's pre-existing PR.

The mutation is `resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: "PRRT_..."})` via `gh api graphql`.

**The `block-raw-pr-merge` false-positive is fixed (#268).** The hook used to fail-closed on
**any** `gh api graphql` call whose query carried a `$variable` — it could not prove the mutation
wasn't a merge, so it blocked, wedging `resolveReviewThread`/`addPullRequestReviewThreadReply`. It
now blocks only an **actual** merge: `gh pr merge` and a literal `mergePullRequest` /
`enablePullRequestAutoMerge` mutation token. A **single-quoted** inline mutation that carries literal
GraphQL variables (`-f query='mutation($t:ID!){resolveReviewThread(input:{threadId:$t})…}'`) is
**allowed** — the shell never expands a single-quoted `$t`, so the query GitHub receives is exactly
the text the hook read and the literal scan is authoritative. A query stays fail-closed when it is
unreadable at pre-exec time: a `@file`/stdin body, or a **shell-expandable** `$`/backtick — one that
is unquoted, double-quoted, or concatenated (`-f query="$Q"`, `-f query="mutation{$OP}"`,
`-f query='…'$OP'…'`) — because the shell rewrites it at runtime and could splice a merge past the
literal scan. So an agent that meets the four conditions can run the resolve mutation directly (keep
the query single-quoted).

**Two ways to resolve, both live:**

- **Direct — the autonomous agent path.** Run `gh api graphql -f
  query='mutation($t:ID!){resolveReviewThread(input:{threadId:$t}){thread{isResolved}}}' -F
  t=PRRT_...` — no longer blocked by the hook (#268). This is the path the **four conditions above
  govern**: the agent is responsible for verifying quorum-passed, advisory-severity, all-bot, and
  own-PR before issuing the mutation.
- **Through ship — an explicit operator flag, narrower and self-enforcing.** `gh ship <PR>
  --resolve-addressed-threads` is **not** the autonomous path and does **not** rely on the agent's
  judgement of the four conditions; it enforces its own conservative rule against live PR data: it
  resolves a thread only when it is unresolved **and** `isOutdated` (the anchored code changed — a
  later commit addressed it) **and** authored **entirely** by bots (with comment-truncation and
  null-author both failing closed). A human or still-current thread is never touched and still blocks.
  It runs during ship's preflight, so if a **later** gate (review-dwell, version-bump, quorum,
  clean-worktree) then refuses, some eligible bot nits may already be resolved on a PR that does not
  merge *this* run — accepted, because those nits are genuinely addressed and would need resolving on
  the next run anyway; the flag never resolves a human or unaddressed thread regardless of outcome.
