"""agents-hooks/v1 pre-bash hook — require a looked-at screenshot before a UI commit.

Fires on a `git commit`. If the staged change touches USER-VISIBLE files (a component, a
stylesheet, an image, a page/view) it BLOCKs unless a fresh "I looked at a screenshot"
marker exists. It enforces `visual-proof-cycle`: capture the rendered result, read the
capture back, verify it — THEN commit. A "done" claim on a UI change with no screenshot you
actually looked at is the exact failure this gate stops.

What counts as user-visible (staged file inspection):
  - an extension match: .tsx/.jsx/.vue/.svelte/.css/.scss/.less/.html/.svg/.png/.jpg/.jpeg/.gif/.webp
  - OR a path under components/ ui/ pages/ app/ views/ public/ assets/
  If NO user-visible file is staged → allow (nothing to prove).

The marker contract (how it knows a screenshot was looked at):
  The visual-proof-cycle skill / a screenshot-capture step touches a file in:
      ~/.cache/agent-tools/visual-proof/<key>     (mtime = "looked at it" time)
  Any fresh file in that dir (within VISUAL_PROOF_WINDOW_S, default 3600s) satisfies the gate.
  Configure the dir with VISUAL_PROOF_DIR.

This gate straight-BLOCKs (doctrine: "block a commit ... with no attached screenshot"), but
is satisfiable (touch the marker after you VIEW the capture).

NOTE: NOT subagent-exempt — a subagent committing UI work must also have looked at the result.

No self-service bypass. There is NO env var / inline sentinel an agent can set on its own
command to skip this gate — a self-grant is security theater. If you have a genuine reason to
commit UI work without a fresh screenshot marker, ASK the human, or request a ONE-TIME Telegram
approval via `RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_VISUAL_PROOF_GATE="<justification>"` (deny-by-default; a blank
or bare `1` is rejected — the value must be a real written justification). The request routes to
the human over Telegram (tg-ctl) and allows ONLY on their approval.

Contract (agents-hooks/v1):
  stdin  : JSON event; the shell command is in args.command, the repo cwd in event.cwd
  stdout : protocol JSON only       exit 0 : allow   exit 10 : BLOCK   other : error

on_error is "open": process discipline, not a security boundary. The `git diff --cached`
subprocess is timeout-bounded and fails OPEN (if git errors, allow) — a broken stat must
never wedge committing.

    Regression (review finding on agent-tools#201's own fix): a `cd` recognized because its
    segment carried a leading `(` is only actually reached BY THE COMMIT if the SAME subshell
    that `cd` ran inside is still open when the commit executes — `(cd repoB && git commit -m
    x)` (subshell wraps the commit too) resolves to repoB correctly, but `(cd repoB && true) ;
    git commit -m x` (subshell CLOSES before the commit, a realistic "cd elsewhere, do a
    thing, then commit back home" idiom) must NOT resolve to repoB: a real shell's subshell is
    a forked child process, so its `cd` never persists past the subshell's own closing `)` —
    the commit after it actually lands in the ORIGINAL directory.

    Tracks paren depth token-by-token across the WHOLE command (not just before/after
    snapshots): `depth_at_cd` is the depth right after the `cd` segment's own opening
    marker; from that token onward — through the rest of ITS OWN segment, then every later
    segment up to the commit — the RUNNING MINIMUM depth reached must never dip below
    `depth_at_cd`. A single dip means the subshell closed at some point, EVEN IF an
    unrelated SIBLING subshell later reopens back to the same nesting depth (review finding,
    round 2): `(cd /decoy && true) ; (echo ok && git commit -m x)` — the first subshell
    (with the `cd`) closes, then a wholly separate second subshell (no `cd` inside it at
    all) happens to reopen to the SAME depth before the commit. Comparing only the depth
    value right before the commit can't tell these apart (both read "depth 1"); the RUNNING
    MINIMUM can, because it dips to `depth_at_cd - 1` in between regardless of what
    re-opens afterward. Still not full nesting-aware matching (which exact subshell — by
    position — reopened), but sufficient for the shapes review has actually surfaced; any
    deeper imprecision is scoped identically to this file's other documented gaps.

    Deliberately `(`/`)` ONLY, NOT `{`/`}`: unlike a subshell, `{ cmds; }` is a plain GROUP
    command that runs in the CURRENT shell (no fork) — a `cd` inside it genuinely persists
    past the closing `}`, so counting `}` as a closer here would wrongly distrust a `{ cd

def effective_cwd(command: str, session_cwd: str) -> str:
    """Resolve the ACTUAL directory a `git commit` in `command` runs against.

    A command like `cd /other-repo && git commit ...` or `git -C /other-repo commit ...`
    targets a DIFFERENT repo than the session's own working directory (`event.cwd`) — trusting
    the raw session cwd here would check the wrong repo's staged files entirely (a session
    rooted in repo A committing into repo B via `cd`/`-C` was silently graded against A's
    staged files, producing false positives/negatives unrelated to the actual commit).

    Walks command segments (split on shell separators) left to right, applying each leading
    `cd <dir>` (a real, persistent shell cwd change) UP TO the commit segment, then applies
    that segment's OWN `-C <dir>` if present (git's own precedence: `-C` wins over ambient cwd
    for that one invocation) and stops there. Two things a naive whole-command walk gets
    wrong, both fixed by stopping at the commit segment:
      - a `cd` AFTER the commit (`git commit -m x && cd /elsewhere`) runs only once the commit
        has already happened — it must NOT retroactively change which repo got checked;
      - a `-C` on some OTHER, non-commit git invocation (`git -C /other status && git commit`)
        only scopes that single git call, not the shell's cwd — it must not leak forward onto
        the commit segment's own resolution.
    Best-effort: any parse failure or unrecognized segment shape falls back to `session_cwd`
    unchanged (fail open, matches the rest of this hook's error-handling philosophy). NOTE:
    this can only see a `cd`/`-C` that appears IN this command string — a `cd` issued as a
    separate, earlier shell invocation (persisted shell state across two distinct tool calls)
    is invisible here; that case relies entirely on the caller's `session_cwd` already being
    correct.

    TWO OR MORE commit segments in one command (`git -C /decoy commit -m x && git commit -m
    y`) are AMBIGUOUS: resolving to just the first one's directory would let a harmless-
    looking decoy commit (or a legitimate "commit in repo A, then commit in repo B" chain)
    hide a REAL, unproven commit that lands wherever this call returns nothing for. Rather
    than guess which commit `main()` should actually be gating, this falls back to
    `session_cwd` unchanged whenever there isn't EXACTLY ONE commit segment — the same safe
    default this whole function is a refinement of, restored for the case it can't safely
    resolve on its own. KNOWN GAP (agent-tools#175): this closes the decoy-first bypass but
    does not evaluate every commit segment's OWN target — two real commits into two
    different non-session_cwd repos in one chain still only get session_cwd checked.

    A `cd` is only TRUSTED (applied to `cur`) when it is the first segment or is preceded by
    `&&`/`;` (see `_CD_TRUSTED_SEP`) — the separators where a preceding `cd`'s cwd change
    stays in the SAME shell process as what follows. A `cd` preceded by `||` is only reached
    when an EARLIER command FAILED, so if the commit after it actually runs, that `cd` did
    NOT succeed — trusting its target would be backwards. A `cd` preceded by `|`/`&` runs (if
    at all) in a SUBSHELL whose cwd change never reaches the parent shell.

    The SAME subshell problem applies looking FORWARD, not just backward: `cd /x | git
    commit` and `cd /x & git commit` put the `cd` itself into a subshell/background job (a
    pipeline's left side, or anything before `&`), so even a LEADING `cd` (trusted by the
    preceding-separator check above) never changes the cwd the following `git commit`
    actually runs in — the commit still lands in `session_cwd`. So a `cd` immediately
    FOLLOWED BY `|`/`&` is untrusted too, regardless of what precedes it.

    Trusting an untrusted `cd` anyway would resolve to a real, existing, but IRRELEVANT other
    repo and check it instead of `session_cwd` (where the actual commit lands). So an
    untrusted `cd` (by either check) aborts the whole resolution to `session_cwd`, the same
    as an unresolvable target.

    KNOWN GAP: `&&` is trusted even though, in principle, an adversarial predecessor could be
    CRAFTED to fail on purpose and reach a REAL, existing, but irrelevant repo via a `;` that
    then decouples the eventual commit's execution from whether that `cd` actually ran
    (`false && cd /real-but-irrelevant-repo ; git commit` — a real shell never runs that
    `cd`, so the commit lands in `session_cwd`, but this function would still resolve to the
    other repo). Closing this precisely requires validating the ENTIRE path from a `cd` to
    the commit segment is unbroken `&&` (agent-tools#173), not just the single separator
    immediately around each `cd`. Accepted as a documented, narrow residual gap — this hook's
    own doctrine is `on_error: open` / process discipline, not a security boundary, and the
    common, benign `setup && cd target && git commit` pattern (which trusting `&&` is what
    makes work at all) is far higher value than defending this specific adversarial shape.

    KNOWN GAP (agent-tools#173): tokenization here is plain `shlex.split`, which glues a
    separator with no surrounding whitespace to the adjacent word (`cd /repo;git commit` ->
    one token `/repo;git`, never segmented) — `require_review.py` already solved this with a
    `punctuation_chars`-based tokenizer that this function should eventually adopt too.

    FIXED (agent-tools#201, PR #176 review finding): the parenthesized-subshell idiom
    `(cd <worktree> && git commit ...)` used to defeat `cd`-detection entirely (`shlex.split`
    glues the `(` onto `cd`, so `seg[0] == "cd"` never matched) — see `_strip_leading_grouping`.
    A second finding on that same fix (also #201): a subshell that CLOSES before the commit
    (`(cd repoB && true) ; git commit -m x`) must NOT be trusted, including when a wholly
    unrelated SIBLING subshell later reopens to the same nesting depth before the commit —
    see `_subshell_cd_still_trusted_at_commit`.

    KNOWN GAP (agent-tools#201, deferred — not the confirmed exploit shape, and low-realism):
    a subshell-wrapped commit with NO `-m`/`-F` value (`(cd repoB && git commit)`) glues the
    closing `)` onto `commit` itself (`"commit)"`), which `_commit_flags`' exact `segment[i]
    != "commit"` comparison doesn't recognize — this function then sees zero commit segments
    and falls back to session_cwd. Not chased here: a bare `git commit` with no message opens
    an interactive editor, which isn't a realistic agent-driven shell invocation (same
    tokenization-gluing family as #173; a `punctuation_chars` tokenizer would close this too)."""
