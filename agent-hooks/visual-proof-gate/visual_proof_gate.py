"""agents-hooks/v1 pre-bash hook — require a looked-at screenshot before a UI commit.

Fires on a `git commit`. If the staged change touches USER-VISIBLE files (a component, a
stylesheet, an image, a page/view) it BLOCKs unless a fresh "I looked at a screenshot"
marker exists. It enforces `visual-proof-cycle`: capture the rendered result, read the
capture back, verify it — THEN commit. A "done" claim on a UI change with no screenshot you
actually looked at is the exact failure this gate stops.

What counts as user-visible (staged file inspection):
  - an extension match: .tsx/.jsx/.vue/.svelte/.css/.scss/.less/.html/.svg/.png/.jpg/.jpeg/.gif/.webp
  - OR a path under components/ ui/ pages/ app/ views/ public/ assets/
  If NO user-visible file is staged → allow (nothing to prove).

The marker contract (how it knows a screenshot was looked at — agent-tools#475):
  Two kinds of marker, both scanned from ~/.cache/agent-tools/visual-proof/ (configure the dir
  with VISUAL_PROOF_DIR), both must be FRESH (within VISUAL_PROOF_WINDOW_S, default 3600s):

  1. PRIMARY — a dev-cli `dev shot <url> --out /tmp/shot.png` attestation (`attest-*.json`,
     written by dev-cli's `write_attestation()`; the output path MUST be OUTSIDE the repo — see
     the README for why). This gate accepts the record only when ALL of:
     `repo` is this commit's resolved git toplevel; `staged_sha256` is the sha256 of THIS
     commit's `git diff --cached` right now; `worktree_dirty` was recorded as exactly `False`
     (a dirty worktree at capture time means the browser may have rendered content that was
     never staged at all); and `capture_sha256` matches a FRESH re-hash of the file at
     `capture_path` (proves an actual capture file exists, not just two `git`-derived facts a
     forger could type by hand). A record failing any one of these does not satisfy the gate.
  2. FALLBACK (no URL to shoot — a docs-only visual change, a generated image, a schematic per
     visual-proof-cycle) — `visual_proof_gate.py --write-marker` writes a plain marker whose
     content is this commit's resolved git toplevel path. Weaker than (1) — it is not bound to
     the staged diff — but still repo-scoped and content-checked, unlike the old bare `touch`.

  BOTH close the same hole: previously ANY fresh file, of ANY content, anywhere in the shared
  marker directory satisfied EVERY repo's gate machine-wide (agent-tools#475) — an agent
  screenshotting repo A silently satisfied repo B's unrelated commit for up to an hour, and a
  junk file dropped there by anything else worked just as well as a real screenshot. See
  `_proof_fresh` for the validation.

  KNOWN, ACCEPTED GAP (review finding, round 4): this hook is a `pre-bash` hook — it inspects
  the command about to run and returns a verdict BEFORE the shell actually executes `git
  commit`. There is no lock between "this hook approved the currently-staged diff" and "the
  shell's `git commit` reads the index a moment later" — a concurrent `git add`/`git reset` in
  that gap can change what actually gets committed after the check already passed. This is not
  specific to the diff-hash binding added here; it is inherent to every check this whole file
  performs (`staged_files`, the skip-flag parse, all of it) and to the pre-bash hook model in
  general — a hook that only sees an event over stdin has no way to make the subsequent shell
  execution atomic with its own check. Closing it would need the actual `git commit` process
  itself to be wrapped/locked, which is out of a pre-bash hook's reach. Matches this file's
  stated doctrine (`on_error: "open"`: process discipline, not a security boundary) — accepted
  here rather than silently ignored.

This gate straight-BLOCKs (doctrine: "block a commit ... with no attached screenshot"), but
is satisfiable (touch the marker after you VIEW the capture).

NOTE: NOT subagent-exempt — a subagent committing UI work must also have looked at the result.

No self-service bypass. There is NO env var / inline sentinel an agent can set on its own
command to skip this gate — a self-grant is security theater. If you have a genuine reason to
commit UI work without a fresh screenshot marker, ASK the human, or request a ONE-TIME Telegram
approval via `RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_VISUAL_PROOF_GATE="<justification>"` (deny-by-default; a blank
or bare `1` is rejected — the value must be a real written justification). The request routes to
the human over Telegram (tg-ctl) and allows ONLY on their approval.

Contract (agents-hooks/v1):
  stdin  : JSON event; the shell command is in args.command, the repo cwd in event.cwd
  stdout : protocol JSON only       exit 0 : allow   exit 10 : BLOCK   other : error

on_error is "open": process discipline, not a security boundary. The `git diff --cached`
subprocess is timeout-bounded and fails OPEN (if git errors, allow) — a broken stat must
never wedge committing.

    Regression (review finding on agent-tools#201's own fix): a `cd` recognized because its
    segment carried a leading `(` is only actually reached BY THE COMMIT if the SAME subshell
    that `cd` ran inside is still open when the commit executes — `(cd repoB && git commit -m
    x)` (subshell wraps the commit too) resolves to repoB correctly, but `(cd repoB && true) ;
    git commit -m x` (subshell CLOSES before the commit, a realistic "cd elsewhere, do a

    a forked child process, so its `cd` never persists past the subshell's own closing `)` —
    the commit after it actually lands in the ORIGINAL directory.

    Tracks paren depth token-by-token across the WHOLE command (not just before/after
    snapshots): `depth_at_cd` is the depth right after the `cd` segment's own opening
    marker; from that token onward — through the rest of ITS OWN segment, then every later
    segment up to the commit — the RUNNING MINIMUM depth reached must never dip below
    `depth_at_cd`. A single dip means the subshell closed at some point, EVEN IF an
    unrelated SIBLING subshell later reopens back to the same nesting depth (review finding,
    round 2): `(cd /decoy && true) ; (echo ok && git commit -m x)` — the first subshell
    (with the `cd`) closes, then a wholly separate second subshell (no `cd` inside it at
    all) happens to reopen to the SAME depth before the commit. Comparing only the depth
    value right before the commit can't tell these apart (both read "depth 1"); the RUNNING
    MINIMUM can, because it dips to `depth_at_cd - 1` in between regardless of what
    re-opens afterward. Still not full nesting-aware matching (which exact subshell — by
    position — reopened), but sufficient for the shapes review has actually surfaced; any
    deeper imprecision is scoped identically to this file's other documented gaps.

    Deliberately `(`/`)` ONLY, NOT `{`/`}`: unlike a subshell, `{ cmds; }` is a plain GROUP
    command that runs in the CURRENT shell (no fork) — a `cd` inside it genuinely persists
    past the closing `}`, so counting `}` as a closer here would wrongly distrust a `{ cd

    The shell expands a leading `~` or `~user` to a home directory BEFORE the program (cd,
    git) ever sees the word — `cd ~/repo` never receives a literal tilde. Skipping that step
    here left `~` un-expanded and glued onto `cur` as a plain relative path segment

    `git -C <bogus path> diff --cached` fail and the whole gate fail OPEN — silently skipping

def effective_cwd(command: str, session_cwd: str) -> str:
    """Resolve the ACTUAL directory a `git commit` in `command` runs against.

    A command like `cd /other-repo && git commit ...` or `git -C /other-repo commit ...`
    targets a DIFFERENT repo than the session's own working directory (`event.cwd`) — trusting
    the raw session cwd here would check the wrong repo's staged files entirely (a session
    rooted in repo A committing into repo B via `cd`/`-C` was silently graded against A's
    staged files, producing false positives/negatives unrelated to the actual commit).

    Walks command segments (split on shell separators) left to right, applying each leading
    `cd <dir>` (a real, persistent shell cwd change) UP TO the commit segment, then applies
    that segment's OWN `-C <dir>` if present (git's own precedence: `-C` wins over ambient cwd
    for that one invocation) and stops there. Two things a naive whole-command walk gets
    wrong, both fixed by stopping at the commit segment:
      - a `cd` AFTER the commit (`git commit -m x && cd /elsewhere`) runs only once the commit
        has already happened — it must NOT retroactively change which repo got checked;
      - a `-C` on some OTHER, non-commit git invocation (`git -C /other status && git commit`)
        only scopes that single git call, not the shell's cwd — it must not leak forward onto
        the commit segment's own resolution.
    Best-effort: any parse failure or unrecognized segment shape falls back to `session_cwd`
    unchanged (fail open, matches the rest of this hook's error-handling philosophy). NOTE:
    this can only see a `cd`/`-C` that appears IN this command string — a `cd` issued as a
    separate, earlier shell invocation (persisted shell state across two distinct tool calls)
    is invisible here; that case relies entirely on the caller's `session_cwd` already being
    correct.

    TWO OR MORE commit segments in one command (`git -C /decoy commit -m x && git commit -m
    y`) are AMBIGUOUS: resolving to just the first one's directory would let a harmless-
    looking decoy commit (or a legitimate "commit in repo A, then commit in repo B" chain)
    hide a REAL, unproven commit that lands wherever this call returns nothing for. Rather
    than guess which commit `main()` should actually be gating, this falls back to
    `session_cwd` unchanged whenever there isn't EXACTLY ONE commit segment — the same safe
    default this whole function is a refinement of, restored for the case it can't safely
    resolve on its own. KNOWN GAP (agent-tools#175): this closes the decoy-first bypass but
    does not evaluate every commit segment's OWN target — two real commits into two
    different non-session_cwd repos in one chain still only get session_cwd checked.

    A `cd` is only TRUSTED (applied to `cur`) when it is the first segment or is preceded by
    `&&`/`;` (see `_CD_TRUSTED_SEP`) — the separators where a preceding `cd`'s cwd change
    stays in the SAME shell process as what follows. A `cd` preceded by `||` is only reached
    when an EARLIER command FAILED, so if the commit after it actually runs, that `cd` did
    NOT succeed — trusting its target would be backwards. A `cd` preceded by `|`/`&` runs (if
    at all) in a SUBSHELL whose cwd change never reaches the parent shell.

    The SAME subshell problem applies looking FORWARD, not just backward: `cd /x | git
    commit` and `cd /x & git commit` put the `cd` itself into a subshell/background job (a
    pipeline's left side, or anything before `&`), so even a LEADING `cd` (trusted by the
    preceding-separator check above) never changes the cwd the following `git commit`
    actually runs in — the commit still lands in `session_cwd`. So a `cd` immediately
    FOLLOWED BY `|`/`&` is untrusted too, regardless of what precedes it.

    Trusting an untrusted `cd` anyway would resolve to a real, existing, but IRRELEVANT other
    repo and check it instead of `session_cwd` (where the actual commit lands). So an
    untrusted `cd` (by either check) aborts the whole resolution to `session_cwd`, the same
    as an unresolvable target.

    KNOWN GAP: `&&` is trusted even though, in principle, an adversarial predecessor could be
    CRAFTED to fail on purpose and reach a REAL, existing, but irrelevant repo via a `;` that
    then decouples the eventual commit's execution from whether that `cd` actually ran
    (`false && cd /real-but-irrelevant-repo ; git commit` — a real shell never runs that
    `cd`, so the commit lands in `session_cwd`, but this function would still resolve to the
    other repo). Closing this precisely requires validating the ENTIRE path from a `cd` to
    the commit segment is unbroken `&&` (agent-tools#173), not just the single separator
    immediately around each `cd`. Accepted as a documented, narrow residual gap — this hook's
    own doctrine is `on_error: open` / process discipline, not a security boundary, and the
    common, benign `setup && cd target && git commit` pattern (which trusting `&&` is what
    makes work at all) is far higher value than defending this specific adversarial shape.

    KNOWN GAP (agent-tools#173): tokenization here is plain `shlex.split`, which glues a
    separator with no surrounding whitespace to the adjacent word (`cd /repo;git commit` ->
    one token `/repo;git`, never segmented) — `require_review.py` already solved this with a
    `punctuation_chars`-based tokenizer that this function should eventually adopt too.

    FIXED (agent-tools#201, PR #176 review finding): the parenthesized-subshell idiom
    `(cd <worktree> && git commit ...)` used to defeat `cd`-detection entirely (`shlex.split`
    glues the `(` onto `cd`, so `seg[0] == "cd"` never matched) — see `_strip_leading_grouping`.
    A second finding on that same fix (also #201): a subshell that CLOSES before the commit
    (`(cd repoB && true) ; git commit -m x`) must NOT be trusted, including when a wholly
    unrelated SIBLING subshell later reopens to the same nesting depth before the commit —
    see `_subshell_cd_still_trusted_at_commit`.

    KNOWN GAP (agent-tools#201, deferred — not the confirmed exploit shape, and low-realism):
    a subshell-wrapped commit with NO `-m`/`-F` value (`(cd repoB && git commit)`) glues the
    closing `)` onto `commit` itself (`"commit)"`), which `_commit_flags`' exact `segment[i]
    != "commit"` comparison doesn't recognize — this function then sees zero commit segments
    and falls back to session_cwd. Not chased here: a bare `git commit` with no message opens
    an interactive editor, which isn't a realistic agent-driven shell invocation (same
    tokenization-gluing family as #173; a `punctuation_chars` tokenizer would close this too)."""

    bound to EXACTLY this repo, EXACTLY this staged diff, AND an actual capture file that still
    exists with the exact bytes it was recorded for.

    `repo` + `staged_sha256` alone are NOT enough (review finding, round 1): both are plain
    `git` queries any agent can run directly, so a record built from just those two fields is a
    forgery an agent can hand-write with zero screenshot involved — no stronger than the manual
    fallback marker below, despite claiming to be. Recomputing `capture_sha256` from the file at
    `capture_path` right now closes that: passing requires a real file on disk whose bytes hash
    to the recorded digest, not just knowledge of two `git` outputs. `record["repo"]` is
    realpath-normalized the same way `_repo_toplevel` normalizes ours, so the comparison isn't
    defeated by a trailing slash or an unresolved symlink component. (This still cannot judge
    whether the capture was BLANK/degenerate — that verdict lives in dev-cli's own
    `verdict_for`/`measure_png`, which only runs at capture time and is not re-run here; a
    forger who fabricates a plausible-looking non-blank PNG and hand-computes every field still
    gets through. That is a materially higher bar than "type two git commands", and matches
    this whole marker family's stated honesty-contract, not cryptographic-proof, doctrine.)

    `worktree_dirty` must be exactly `False` (review finding, round 2): dev-cli's `write_attestation`
    records it because the BROWSER renders the WORKING TREE, but the binding is to the INDEX
    (`git diff --cached`) — if the worktree had already diverged from the index at capture time
    (an unstaged edit made after staging, or an untracked asset), the screenshot may show content
    that was never staged at all, even though `repo` and `staged_sha256` both still check out
    (they describe the index at capture time, not what the browser actually rendered). Missing,
    `None`, or `True` are all rejected — only a positively-confirmed clean worktree passes.

    Every field is UNTRUSTED, attacker/agent-controlled JSON — the whole point of this function
    is judging a record an adversarial caller may have hand-crafted to defeat the gate (review
    finding, round 3). Two distinct hazards follow from that, both closed here rather than left
    to propagate:
      - A `capture_path` containing an embedded NUL (`"\\u0000"`) makes `os.path.realpath` /
        `Path(...)` raise `ValueError`, not `OSError`. Left uncaught, that propagates out of
        this function, `_proof_fresh`, and `main()` entirely — and this hook's descriptor is
        `on_error: "open"`, so a CRASHED gate is an ALLOWED commit, the exact bypass this whole
        fix exists to close, just reached by a different route than a wrong field value. Every
        extraction/read here catches `ValueError` alongside the expected `KeyError`/`TypeError`.
      - A `capture_path` pointing at a FIFO (or a symlink to one) makes a naive read BLOCK
        FOREVER; past this hook's own timeout that is ALSO an allowed commit (a hung hook is a
        crashed hook, same `on_error: "open"` consequence). `_safe_regular_file_bytes` rejects
        anything that isn't a plain, size-bounded regular file before ever attempting to read
        it — see its own docstring.

    Requires `tool == "dev shot"` and `version == _EXPECTED_ATTESTATION_VERSION` exactly
    (review finding, round 4): an older/foreign producer's record measured blankness and
    `worktree_dirty` differently (see the constant's own comment) — accepting it just because
    its `repo`/`staged_sha256` happen to line up would silently trust guarantees it never

    failure, not the common path (see its docstring). Unlike the rest of this hook's git
    queries, that is NOT treated as fail-open here: this function's whole job is proving a
    marker is bound to a specific repo, and a None repo means there is nothing to bind against
    — silently allowing would hand back exactly the "any file, anywhere, satisfies every repo"
    hole this exists to close. It falls through to the normal BLOCK/hatch path instead, which
    still isn't a wedge — the Telegram hatch is always available.

    Every fresh (mtime-windowed) file in PROOF_DIR is inspected — `.json` files as a `dev shot`
    attestation (see `_attestation_satisfies`), everything else as a manual marker (see
    `_manual_marker_satisfies`) — and this returns True on the first one that validates against
    `repo_root`. The staged-diff hash is computed at most once per call (lazily, only if a
    `.json` marker is actually present), since it costs a `git diff --cached` subprocess.

    Freshness requires `0 <= age <= PROOF_WINDOW_S`, not just `age <= PROOF_WINDOW_S` (review
    finding, round 4): a marker whose mtime is set in the FUTURE has a NEGATIVE age, which the
    one-sided check would treat as fresh forever — right up until that future date actually
    arrives. A future mtime is never legitimate (nothing in this hook's own writers, nor
    dev-cli's, ever backdates or postdates a marker), so it is rejected the same as a stale
    one rather than silently trusted.

    Inspects at most `_MAX_MARKERS_SCANNED` FRESH candidates, not every file in PROOF_DIR
    (review finding, round 6): a per-file size cap alone doesn't bound TOTAL work when there
    are many files — thousands of fresh, valid-shaped `.json` markers, each pointing at a large
    regular file with a deliberately wrong hash, each still costs a real read-and-hash before
    being rejected, and enough of them can push total scan time past this hook's own timeout
    (`on_error: "open"` turns THAT into an allowed commit too). Exceeding the cap does not fail
