"""agents-hooks/v1 pre-bash hook — send-time escalation-format gate.

When the agent escalates to the human's out-of-band channel — a ``tg --tag decision`` /
``--tag problem`` invocation — this inspects the message body for the structural markers the
`decision-request-discipline` skill requires (Context, Options / pros-cons table,
Recommendation). Both tags are the same escalation shape, so the check applies to each — an
agent picking ``problem`` instead of ``decision`` no longer skips it (agent-tools#213/#12).

There is NO ``question`` tag any more (agent-tools#524, tg-cli#301, Alex 2026-09-05): an open
question for the human IS a decision request and goes out as ``--tag decision`` in the
decision-request format. ``tg`` itself refuses the ``question`` tag; this hook BLOCKS the command
one step earlier (exit 10) with the same one-line hint, so the agent is redirected before a
doomed send ever runs. That block is unconditional — no hatch applies, because there is nothing
to force through: the tag does not exist.

Graduated, deliberately lenient verdict (Alex: hard-block a bare decision request, but a false positive
would wedge his ONLY comms channel to his agents, so err HARD toward passing):

  - COMPLETE body (all three markers)                 → silent allow (exit 0)
  - PARTIAL body (some structure, some missing)        → allow + an exit-0 advisory nudge
  - genuinely BARE body — a bare "A or B?" with NO
    table and NONE of the three markers               → **BLOCK (exit 10)**, the send does not
    run; the message shows the exact skeleton to re-send. A justified
    ``RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_DECISION_REQUEST_FORMAT`` hatch still forces it through.

ONLY the bare case blocks. A message that carries a pros/cons table (markdown OR HTML) — or any
one of Context / Options / Recommendation — is never blocked. Table detection is generous on
purpose: over-detecting only lets a message THROUGH.

Matching is by proper parsing, not raw-string search: the command is split into ``&&``/
``;``/``|`` segments, leading no-op wrappers (``env``, ``timeout``, ``nice``, …) are peeled,
and each segment is shlex-tokenized so a ``tg`` substring in a path or another flag's value
never trips it — only an actual ``tg`` command carrying an escalation ``--tag`` does.

NOT subagent-exempt: the check binds every agent, including the subagent that (per the skill)
drafts the request.

Escape (replaces the OLD self-service hatch): there is NO ``ALLOW_RAW_DECISION_REQUEST`` env or
``# decision-request-ok:`` inline sentinel any more — an agent could set either on its own
command. A one-time force-through of a bare body is requested by setting
``RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_DECISION_REQUEST_FORMAT="<written justification>"``, which routes a single
approval to the human via Telegram (deny-by-default; a bare ``1`` is rejected).

Contract (agents-hooks/v1):
  stdin  : JSON event; the shell command is in args.command
  stdout : protocol JSON only       exit 0 : allow
                                    exit 10 : BLOCK (a bare body — hatchable; or the removed
                                              ``question`` tag — unconditional, no hatch)

on_error is "open": a crash here must never wedge the ability to send a message. EVERY error
path allows; the only hard stops are the deliberate, narrow bare-body block and the removed-tag
block.
