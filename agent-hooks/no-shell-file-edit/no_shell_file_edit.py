"""agents-hooks/v1 pre-bash hook — no sed/perl/awk (or `> file`) for editing source.

The hyperide rule (`~/work/hyperide/docs/rules/development.md`): "edits only via Edit/Write;
NO `sed`/`perl`/`awk` for editing files." A Bash in-place edit (`sed -i`, `perl -i`, `gawk -i
inplace`) or a redirect that OVERWRITES an existing tracked source file (`awk '...' f > f`,
`cmd > src.ts`) bypasses the Edit/Write tools — no diff to review, no formatter, no
file-state tracking. This gate BLOCKs that and points the agent at Edit/Write instead.

What is BLOCKED (decided from a PARSED command, never a raw substring):
  - an in-place stream editor on a tracked source file: `sed -i …`, `perl -i …`,
    `gawk -i inplace …` (also `--in-place`, GNU's `-i.bak`, perl's `-pi`/`-i.orig`, and `-i`
    clustered after other flags: `sed -Ei`/`-ri`/`-ni`). A GLOB operand (`sed -i … *.ts`) is
    expanded against the cwd and blocks if any match is a tracked source (the bulk-edit idiom).
  - a `> file` / `>> file` (or `>|` / `>& file`) redirect whose target is an EXISTING git-TRACKED
    SOURCE file (`awk '{…}' app.ts > app.ts`, `sed 's/a/b/' src/x.py > src/x.py`, `… >app.ts`)
  - `tee FILE` / `tee -a FILE` / `dd of=FILE` writing a tracked source file — the common
    pipe-to-a-file workaround once `>`/`sed -i` are blocked
  - the same wrapped in `bash -c '…'` / `sh -c '…'` — incl. the CLUSTERED form (`bash -ec`,
    `sh -lc`) — the inner script is re-parsed, nested too

What is ALLOWED (the rule is about EDITING, not reading or generating):
  - read-only filters: `sed -n '1,5p' f`, `awk '{print $1}' f | sort`, `grep -v x f` (no `-i`,
    no redirect to a tracked source file)
  - a redirect to /tmp, a brand-NEW file, or a NON-source file (`… > /tmp/x`, `… > out.log`,
    `… > notes.md`, `… > new_file.ts` that isn't tracked yet) — generating, not editing
  - `sed -i` etc. targeting an untracked / non-source path (scratch, build artifact)

Decided from the PARSED command, not a raw string match (codex found raw-string bypasses in
the #59 siblings — do NOT repeat them): shell COMMENTS are stripped ONCE up front (each
word-boundary `#` to its newline, so a multi-line command's later lines still parse and a `$(…)`
in a comment is never run), then the command is split on real separators, each segment is
tokenized with shlex, leading wrappers + a `VAR=val` assignment prefix are peeled, and
`-i`/redirect targets are read off the argv. So `echo "use sed -i"` (the words in a string), `ls #
sed -i later` (a comment), and `git commit -m 'switch to sed -i'` (a message) never trip it, while
`LANG=C sed -i … app.ts` (a common assignment prefix) IS caught.

A command SUBSTITUTION (`echo $(sed -i … f)` / backticks) is recursed into like `bash -c '…'`.

NOT covered (known scope boundary): non-editor file-overwrite idioms — `cp`/`mv`/`install` to a
tracked path, `patch < diff`, `ed -s`, `python -c "open('f','w')…"`; `find … -exec sed -i {} +` /
`… | xargs sed -i` (operands are `{}`/stdin, NOT in the command); a VARIABLE operand (`"$FILE"`,
value unknown statically); process substitution `<(…)`/`>(…)`; and `eval '…'`. The rule's spirit
still applies; this gate enforces the editors/redirects it names, not every write path (on_error=open).

Subagent-exempt? NO. The rule is about HOW any agent edits a file, orchestrator or subagent
alike — a subagent hand-editing with `sed -i` is exactly what this stops. (Contrast the
delegation gates, which govern the orchestrator only.)

External approval (deny-by-default): there is NO self-service bypass. For a genuine exception,
ASK the human, or request a one-time Telegram approval by setting
`RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_NO_SHELL_FILE_EDIT="<written justification>"` — the hook asks via a trusted
`tg-ctl` and allows ONLY on an explicit approval tap. A blank value or a bare `1`/`true` is
rejected (deny), no Telegram call is made. An agent can request, not self-grant — the human
decides.

Contract (agents-hooks/v1):
  stdin  : JSON event; the shell command is in args.command, the repo cwd in event.cwd
  stdout : protocol JSON only       exit 0 : allow   exit 10 : BLOCK   other : error

on_error is "open": edit-hygiene discipline, not a security boundary — a crash (a malformed
command shlex can't tokenize, a git call that errors) must never wedge the ability to run a
command. The git-tracked lookup is timeout-bounded and fails toward ALLOW on the redirect
case (unknown tracked-ness → not provably an edit of a tracked source file).

    heredoc (e.g. generating a script or doc) must not be scanned as a real edit (codex false
    positive). The `<<WORD` line itself is kept (its command may still edit); only the body lines up
    to the terminator are removed. `<<-` (tab-stripped) is handled the same. The opener is detected
    quote-aware (`_heredoc_terminator`), so a `<<` inside a quoted string / commit message is NOT
    treated as a heredoc and the following lines keep being scanned. If no terminator line is found,
