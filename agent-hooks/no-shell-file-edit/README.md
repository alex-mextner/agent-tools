# no-shell-file-edit

**Point:** `pre-bash` · **Fail policy:** `open` · **Priority:** 36

Enforces the hyperide rule (`~/work/hyperide/docs/rules/development.md`): **"edits only via
Edit/Write; no `sed`/`perl`/`awk` for editing files."** A shell in-place edit or a redirect
that overwrites a tracked source file bypasses the Edit/Write tools — no reviewable diff, no
formatter run, no file-state tracking. This gate **hard-blocks** that case and points the
agent at Edit/Write.

## Blocked (each decided from a PARSED command — never a raw substring)

- an **in-place stream editor on a tracked source file**: `sed -i …`, `perl -i …`,
  `gawk -i inplace …` (also `--in-place`, GNU's `-i.bak`, perl's `-pi` / `-i.orig` clusters, and
  `-i` clustered after other flags: `sed -Ei` / `-ri` / `-ni`)
- a **`> file` / `>> file` redirect onto a tracked source file** — including the operator glued to
  a word (`… app.ts>app.ts`), bash's `>|` and zsh's `>!` force-clobber, and `>& file`:
  `awk '{…}' app.ts > app.ts`, `sed 's/a/b/' src/x.py > src/x.py`, `grep -v x f.js > f.js`
- a **`tee FILE` / `tee -a FILE` / `dd of=FILE`** writing a tracked source file — the common
  pipe-to-a-file workaround once `>` / `sed -i` are blocked
- the same wrapped in **`bash -c '…'` / `sh -c '…'`** — the inner script is re-parsed and scanned
  (nested `bash -c "bash -c '…'"` too, up to a small depth cap), and the **outer** redirect of a
  `bash -c '…' > app.ts` is checked as well

"Tracked source file" = an **existing git-tracked** file with a **source extension**
(`.ts/.tsx/.js/.py/.go/.rs/.css/.html/.yaml/.sql/…`). Generating a *new* file, or overwriting a
non-source file (`.log`, `.md`, a data dump), is **not** editing source — see Allowed.

Leading **no-op wrappers** are peeled before scanning, so a wrapped edit is still caught:
`timeout 5 sed -i … f`, `env X=1 perl -i … f`, `nice -n10 gawk -i inplace … f`.

**`gawk -i` is in-place only with the `inplace` extension.** gawk's `-i NAME` loads a library;
`gawk -i inplace …` edits in place (blocked), but `gawk -i json …` / `-i readfile …` just loads
that extension and is read-only (allowed).

## Allowed (the rule is about EDITING, not reading or generating)

- **read-only filters** — no `-i`, no redirect to a tracked source file:
  `sed -n '1,5p' f`, `awk '{print $1}' f | sort`, `grep -v x f`
- a **redirect to /tmp, a brand-new file, or a non-source file**:
  `… > /tmp/x`, `… > out.log`, `… > notes.md`, `… > new_file.ts` (not tracked yet)
- `sed -i` / `perl -i` targeting an **untracked / non-source path** (scratch, build artifact)

The scratch exemption is **git-trackedness**, not a `/tmp` string prefix: a real codebase can
live under `/tmp` (CI runners, agent worktrees), so a tracked source file there still blocks; an
untracked `/tmp` scratch file is exempt because `git ls-files` doesn't know it, wherever it sits.

A **leading `VAR=val` assignment prefix** (`LANG=C` / `LC_ALL=C` / `FOO=bar …`) is peeled before
matching, so `LANG=C sed -i … app.ts` is still caught — it is both the most common legitimate
prefix and the simplest bypass otherwise (the assignment would leave an unrecognized command head).

## Known scope boundary (other write idioms)

This gate covers the shell editors the hyperide rule names (`sed`/`perl`/`awk` in-place), the
redirect family, the `tee`/`dd` pipe-to-a-file workaround, **command substitutions**
(`echo $(sed -i … app.ts)` is recursed into like `bash -c '…'`), and **shell globs + brace
expansion** — a glob operand (`sed -i … *.ts`, `src/app.*`) is expanded against the cwd, and a
brace group (`{app,}.ts`, `src/{x,y}.py`) is expanded into its candidate paths first (Python's
glob doesn't do braces); either blocks if any resulting file is a tracked source (the canonical
bulk-edit idioms). **No-op prefixes** `command` / `exec` /
`builtin` are peeled like `timeout`/`env`. A **heredoc body** is treated as data, not commands, so
a `sed -i` *inside* a heredoc (generating a script/doc) is not falsely blocked. It does **not**
police every conceivable way to overwrite a file from the shell:

- `cp /tmp/new app.ts`, `mv … app.ts`, `install … app.ts`, `patch app.ts < x.diff`, `ed -s app.ts`,
  `python -c "open('app.ts','w')…"` / `node -e "…writeFileSync('app.ts'…)"` — a smaller risk (an
  agent reaching for `sed -i` rarely reaches for `cp` to edit), and telling a legit rename from an
  overwrite is its own task.
- **`find … -exec sed -i {} +`** and **`… | xargs sed -i`** — the bulk-edit idioms whose file
  operands are `{}` (a find placeholder) or arrive on stdin, so they are *not present in the
  command* and tracked-ness can't be resolved without running it. Recognizing the bare `sed -i`
  there would block legit `find … -exec sed -i … /tmp/{}` too.
- a **variable operand** (`sed -i … "$FILE"`) — the value isn't known statically, so it can't be
  resolved; **process substitution** `… <(sed -i … app.ts)` / `>(…)`; and **`eval '…'`** are not
  recursed into (exotic). Use Edit/Write (or the Agent tool for a real multi-file codemod).
- **`sudo`** is not peeled, so `sudo sed -i … app.ts` / `… | sudo tee app.ts` pass — editing a
  tracked source as root is rare in an agent loop, and `sudo`'s own option grammar (`-u user`, `-E`,
  `--`) is its own parse. Like find/xargs, it's named here rather than chased; the rule still applies.
- an **awk-internal redirect** (`awk '{print > "app.ts"}' in.txt`) — the `>` lives *inside* awk's
  single-quoted program, which the shell never sees as a redirect and the gate's quote-aware
  redirect splitter deliberately doesn't reach into. Recognizing it would mean parsing each editor's
  own language; exotic, named here rather than chased.
- an in-place editor's **option-argument** is not distinguished from the edit target: every
  non-flag operand of a blocked-editor invocation is checked for tracked-ness, so the contrived
  `sed -i -f lib.py /tmp/scratch` (where `lib.py` is sed's `-f` *script file*, not the target)
  would flag `lib.py`. Modeling each editor's arg-taking options well is its own task; in practice
  the script-file is rarely a tracked source you'd be surprised to see flagged.
- an edit wrapped in **≥5 levels of `bash -c '…'`** is not reached: shell-runner recursion is
  capped at `_MAX_SHELL_DEPTH` (4) so a forged deep nest can't spin into a `RecursionError` /
  fail-open. A real edit is rarely more than 1–2 `bash -c` deep, so the cap costs nothing in
  practice; a deliberately deep nest is an exotic bypass that, like find/xargs, this gate does not
  chase (the same `on_error: open` edit-hygiene posture).

The rule's spirit — *edit via Edit/Write* — still applies to all of these; this gate just isn't the
enforcer for them. `on_error: open` reinforces that this is edit-hygiene, not a security boundary.

## Not a raw-string match (why the bypasses are closed)

The #59 siblings were patched after codex found **raw-string** bypasses (a flag spotted inside a
string or comment). This gate avoids the whole class: the command is **split on real shell
separators** (quote-aware), each segment is **shlex-tokenized**, a trailing **shell comment is
dropped**, and the in-place flag / redirect target are read **off the argv** — not grepped from
the line. So none of these trip it:

```bash
echo "use sed -i to patch"          # the words live inside a string operand
ls -la  # remember: sed -i later     # a comment tail, dropped before parsing
git commit -m 'switch off sed -i'    # the flag is inside the commit MESSAGE
sed 's/-i//' file.ts                  # `-i` is part of the s/// operand, not a flag
```

The in-place flag counts only when it is an actual argv token; the redirect target only blocks
when `git ls-files --error-unmatch` confirms it is tracked **and** the extension is source.

## Not subagent-exempt

Unlike the delegation gates (which govern the orchestrator only), this rule is about **how any
agent edits a file** — a subagent hand-editing with `sed -i` is exactly what it stops. There is
no `agent_id` carve-out here.

## Why a hard block (not warn-first)

A shell file-edit is unambiguous: it edits a tracked source file outside Edit/Write, every time.
There is no borderline case to warn about — so this blocks on the first occurrence,
deny-by-default, with an external Telegram approval for the rare deliberate exception.

## No self-service bypass — external Telegram approval only

There is **no** env-var or inline escape hatch any more. The old `ALLOW_SHELL_FILE_EDIT=1` +
`ALLOW_SHELL_FILE_EDIT_REASON` env and the `# shell-file-edit-ok:` inline sentinel let the very
agent this gate constrains grant itself an exception — security theater, not a permission gate.
Both were removed.

The block is now **deny-by-default**. For a genuine exception (a vetted bulk codemod, a
generated file), ASK the human, or request a one-time Telegram approval with a written
justification:

```bash
RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_NO_SHELL_FILE_EDIT="bulk codemod across 200 files, vetted" \
  sed -i 's/v1/v2/' config.yaml
```

If the env var is unset, no Telegram call is made and the command simply blocks. If it is
present but blank, whitespace-only, or a bare flag value (`1`/`true`/`yes`/`on`), the hook does
not contact Telegram and denies — a bare `1` is not a justification. A real justification runs
`tg-ctl ask` through a trusted absolute path (never ambient `PATH`); exit 0 allows, and any
nonzero exit, launch error, or timeout denies. An agent can *request*, not self-grant.

## Fail-open, on purpose

`on_error: "open"`. Edit-hygiene discipline, not a security boundary — a crash (a command shlex
can't tokenize, a `git` call that errors) must never wedge the ability to run a command. The
`git ls-files` lookup is timeout-bounded and fails toward **allow** on the redirect case
(unknown tracked-ness → not provably an edit of a tracked source file).

## Test

Capture the hook's exit on its OWN line right after the pipe (so it's the hook's exit, not
`echo`'s). Run from inside a git repo where `app.ts` is a tracked file:

```bash
chmod +x no_shell_file_edit.py
CWD=$(pwd)
echo "{\"args\":{\"command\":\"sed -i 's/a/b/' app.ts\"},\"cwd\":\"$CWD\"}" | ./no_shell_file_edit.py; echo " exit=$?"   # → exit=10 (block)
echo "{\"args\":{\"command\":\"awk '{print}' app.ts > app.ts\"},\"cwd\":\"$CWD\"}" | ./no_shell_file_edit.py; echo " exit=$?"  # → exit=10 (block)
echo "{\"args\":{\"command\":\"sed -n '1,5p' app.ts\"},\"cwd\":\"$CWD\"}" | ./no_shell_file_edit.py; echo " exit=$?"   # → exit=0 (read-only filter)
echo "{\"args\":{\"command\":\"awk '{print}' app.ts > /tmp/out.ts\"},\"cwd\":\"$CWD\"}" | ./no_shell_file_edit.py; echo " exit=$?"  # → exit=0 (/tmp)
echo "{\"args\":{\"command\":\"echo \\\"use sed -i\\\"\"},\"cwd\":\"$CWD\"}" | ./no_shell_file_edit.py; echo " exit=$?"  # → exit=0 (string, not a flag)
# deny-by-default: a bare RIG_HATCH_REQUEST value (no written justification) still blocks
RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_NO_SHELL_FILE_EDIT=1 \
  bash -c "echo '{\"args\":{\"command\":\"sed -i s/a/b/ app.ts\"},\"cwd\":\"$CWD\"}' | ./no_shell_file_edit.py"; echo " exit=$?"  # → exit=10 (bare 1 rejected)
```
