"""agents-hooks/v1 pre-bash hook — keep long-running processes off the main thread.

A long-running process started inline by the ORCHESTRATOR blocks the main thread for
minutes — a multi-model `review`, a `--watch` loop, a full build/test suite, a long
`sleep`. This gate hard-BLOCKs such a command and tells the orchestrator to dispatch it
to a BACKGROUND subagent instead. It enforces the "orchestrator stays responsive" half of
`delegate-work-to-subagents` (the most clear-cut case → straight block, not warn-first).

Decided from the PARSED command (argv-aware), NEVER a raw substring of the whole string —
the #59 doctrine (block-no-verify / require-review / visual-proof / skills-read). The old
raw-regex anchored its patterns on shell-separator characters (`(`, `|`, `;`, `&&`); those
same characters appear INSIDE quoted argument strings, so a benign `tg --tag report "…we
ran review-qa (review) today…"` or `git commit -m "wire --watch flag"` was mis-read as a
`review`/`--watch` invocation and BLOCKED (agent-tools#60). The command is now shell-
tokenized (quotes/heredocs honored) and split into segments; a long process is flagged ONLY
when the REAL invoked command — `argv[0]` after leading shell noise, inline env, and no-op
wrappers (`timeout`/`env`/`nice`/`time`/…) are peeled off a segment — is the long-running
runner. A keyword that merely appears inside an argument to a DIFFERENT command (tg/echo/git
commit -m/…) no longer trips it, while a genuine inline `review`/`npm test`/`--watch`/long
`sleep` still does.

Flagged, decided per real command SEGMENT (executable parsed, not substring-matched):
  - the `review` CLI as the invoked command (`argv[0]` is `review`) — multi-model, minutes-long
  - a `--watch` flag token in the real args (gh pr checks --watch, vitest --watch, tsc --watch)
  - a build/test SUITE: npm/pnpm/yarn/bun/deno test|build, pytest/vitest/jest/cypress/playwright,
    cargo/go test|build, make/rake/msbuild test|build|all, mvn/gradle test|build|verify|package
  - `sleep N[unit]` as the invoked command with a duration >= 10s (`sleep 5m`/`sleep 1h` count)

LIMITATION (documented under-block, the same precision trade as the sibling hooks' nested
shell-string limit): a runner hidden inside a QUOTED command substitution (`X="$(npm test)"`),
a backtick (`` `npm test` ``), or a nested shell string (`bash -c 'npm test'`, `sh -c 'review'`)
is NOT re-parsed and so is NOT flagged; likewise a runner passed to a NON-peeled forwarder
(`xargs npm test`) keeps that forwarder as argv[0] and is not flagged (`xargs`/`sh`/`bash` are
not in the no-op wrapper set — unlike `timeout`/`env`/`nice` they change execution semantics). Posix tokenization de-quotes a `"$(…)"` and a `'$(…)'` to the SAME token,
so the active (double-quoted) form is indistinguishable from a literal (single-quoted) one
without full quote-context tracking; flagging it would re-open the #60 FALSE-POSITIVE on a
literal `git commit -m '$(npm test) is the command'`. An UNQUOTED substitution/subshell
(`$(npm test)`, `(review)`) IS caught — its opener is a real segment break. Under-blocking is the
safe direction here: this gate is responsiveness discipline (on_error=open), not a boundary.

RESIDUAL LIMITATION (rare OVER-block, same de-quoting collision): a QUOTED token whose value is
EXACTLY a shell separator/opener (`echo ";" review`, `tg "(" review`) de-quotes under posix shlex to
a token equal to the bare `;` / `(`, indistinguishable from a real unquoted separator without
per-token quote-provenance tracking. So such a quoted break still splits the segment and a runner
RIGHT AFTER it (`tg "(" review`) is flagged. The trigger is pathological (a quoted argument equal to
a lone separator, immediately followed by a bare runner token), and the reported #60 case (a keyword
inside a NORMAL multi-word quoted message, `tg --title x "...review..."`) is fully fixed. A precise
fix means a quote-aware separator scan replacing punctuation_chars across this and the sibling hooks'
shared parser (follow-up, not this change). Pinned by `test_quoted_token_equal_to_separator_*`.

Every harness is governed identically (agent-tools#573): the refusal names the delegation
recipe of the event's top-level ``harness`` tag (``delegation_recipe``), so a codex/opencode/omp
session is told about ITS spawn tool / ``rig-detached-<harness>`` launcher, never about Claude
Code's Agent tool; an untagged event gets every recipe.

Subagent-exempt: a dispatched subagent (``agent_id`` present) is EXPECTED to run these in
the background, so it is always allowed — this gate governs the orchestrator only.

External approval (deny-by-default): there is NO self-service bypass. For a genuine exception,
ASK the human, or request a one-time Telegram approval by setting
`RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_NO_LONG_INLINE_PROCESS="<written justification>"` — the hook asks via a
trusted `tg-ctl` and allows ONLY on an explicit approval tap. A blank value or a bare `1`/`true`
is rejected (deny), no Telegram call is made. An agent can request, not self-grant — the human
decides.

Contract (agents-hooks/v1):
  stdin  : JSON event; the shell command is in args.command
  stdout : protocol JSON only       exit 0 : allow   exit 10 : BLOCK   other : error

on_error is "open": responsiveness discipline, not a security boundary — a crash must never
wedge the ability to run a command. An UNPARSEABLE command (unbalanced quotes) likewise
ALLOWS (fail-open), the opposite of the fail-closed sibling block-no-verify.
