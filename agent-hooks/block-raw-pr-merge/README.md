# block-raw-pr-merge

**Point:** `pre-bash` · **Fail policy:** `closed` · **Priority:** 10 (runs early)

Denies a shell command that merges a PR directly and bypasses the ship gate:

- `gh pr merge <PR>` (squash/merge/rebase, any flags)
- `gh pr merge --admin <PR>` (the admin bypass is the most dangerous case)

Lets the sanctioned merge path through:

- `gh ship <PR>` (and a `gh alias` that runs ship)
- `pr-ship.sh` / `ship.sh` (the script the ship alias points at)
- any non-merge `gh pr` subcommand (`view`, `list`, `checkout`, `create`, `comment`, …)

## Why an agent-hook (not a skill, not a git-hook)

"Use `gh ship`, never a raw merge" was for a long time **advice only** — a line in
`AGENTS.md`. Advice cannot stop an autonomous (auto-mode) agent from running `gh pr merge`:
the moment permission prompts are auto-accepted, a doc rule has zero enforcement and the
green-CI + mandatory-screenshot gates are silently skipped. A git-hook can't help either —
the merge happens server-side on GitHub, not at a local commit/push. The only place to stop
the bypass is **before the command runs**, which is what a `pre-bash` agent-hook does. This
is the enforcement counterpart of the `ci/ship` gate and the ship usage rule.

This guard is what makes auto-mode safe: the agent runs without babysitting, and the guard
catches the one irreversible action (a gate-skipping merge) before the side effect.

## No self-service override — external approval only

There is **no** `ALLOW_RAW_PR_MERGE` (+`_REASON`) env and **no** `# no-ship-guard: <reason>`
inline sentinel any more. An agent could set either on its own command, so those merely let the
guarded agent grant itself the exact bypass this hook exists to stop. The block is now
**deny-by-default**.

Use `gh ship <PR>` (the green-CI-gated, screenshot-checked path). For a genuine one-time
exception, **ask Alex** — or request a single approval by setting
`RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_BLOCK_RAW_PR_MERGE="<written justification>"`:

```bash
RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_BLOCK_RAW_PR_MERGE="ship gate down, manual verify done" \
  gh pr merge 123 --admin
```

That routes one Telegram approval request to Alex (deny-by-default): unset means the hook never
contacts Telegram (the merge just blocks); a blank or bare `1`/`true`/`yes`/`on` is rejected
without a Telegram call; a real justification runs the trusted `tg-ctl ask` and allows the raw
merge **only on exit 0** (any nonzero exit / error / timeout denies, the block leading with
`hatch escalation denied: <reason>`).

## Fail-closed

`on_error: "closed"`. If the hook can't inspect the command (a malformed event, a crash),
it **blocks** rather than allows — a raw merge slipping through a broken guard is the failure
this hook exists to stop.

## Install

```bash
chmod +x block_raw_pr_merge.py
# edit the descriptor's "cmd" to this file's absolute path, then drop the descriptor
# into your harness's pre-bash hook directory. (rig apply does this for you.)
```

## Test

```bash
echo '{"args":{"command":"gh pr merge 123 --admin"}}' | ./block_raw_pr_merge.py; echo "exit=$?"
# → {"hook_api":"agents-hooks/v1","decision":"block",...}  exit=10

echo '{"args":{"command":"gh ship 123"}}' | ./block_raw_pr_merge.py; echo "exit=$?"
# → {"hook_api":"agents-hooks/v1","decision":"allow"}  exit=0
```

A one-time exception is an external Telegram approval — set
`RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_BLOCK_RAW_PR_MERGE="<why>"` (deny-by-default; only an approved `tg-ctl ask`
exit 0 allows the raw merge).
