"""agents-hooks/v1 pre-bash hook — block a raw `gh pr merge` that bypasses ship.

Denies a shell command that merges a PR directly with `gh pr merge` (including
`gh pr merge --admin`), because that skips the project's ship gate: `gh ship <PR>`
(the green-CI-gated merge + mandatory-screenshot command) is the only sanctioned path.
A raw merge lands code without the green-CI check and the required-screenshot check —
exactly the gates ship exists to enforce.

This is the enforcement counterpart of the doc-only "use `gh ship`, never a raw merge"
rule: advice in AGENTS.md cannot stop an autonomous (auto-mode) agent from running
`gh pr merge`, so the rule only becomes real as a mid-session guard.

Detection is ARGV-BASED, not a raw substring match.  The command is parsed via shlex
into shell segments (`;` / `&&` / `||` / `|` separated), and each segment is inspected
for `basename(argv[0])=="gh" && argv[1]=="pr" && argv[2]=="merge"` after stripping
leading inline VAR=value assignments and shell grouping tokens (`(`, `{`).  Using
basename handles path-qualified invocations (`/usr/local/bin/gh pr merge`).  This
prevents a false positive where the body of an unrelated command (e.g. `gh pr create
--body "run gh pr merge to land it"`) triggers the guard — with a raw regex that body
text would match and the command would be blocked even though no actual merge is
occurring.

Allowed (let through):
  - `gh ship <PR>` / a `gh alias` that runs ship
  - `pr-ship.sh` / `ship.sh` (the script the ship alias points at)
  - any non-merge `gh pr` subcommand (view, list, checkout, create, comment, ...)
  - commands whose body/arguments merely contain the text "gh pr merge" as a string

External approval (replaces the OLD self-service escape hatch): there is NO
`ALLOW_RAW_PR_MERGE`(+`_REASON`) env and NO `# no-ship-guard: <reason>` inline sentinel any
more — an agent could set either on its own command, so those merely let the guarded agent
grant itself the bypass this hook exists to stop. The block is now DENY-BY-DEFAULT. Use
`gh ship <PR>` (the green-CI-gated, screenshot-checked path). For a genuine one-time exception,
ASK Alex, or request a single approval by setting
`RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_BLOCK_RAW_PR_MERGE="<written justification>"`, which routes one Telegram
approval request to Alex (deny-by-default; a bare `1`/`true` is rejected). Only an approved
`tg-ctl ask` (exit 0) allows the raw merge; anything else denies.

Contract (agents-hooks/v1):
  stdin  : JSON event; the shell command is in args.command (a few fallbacks below)
  stdout : protocol JSON only
  stderr : human logs
  exit 0 : allow      exit 10 : BLOCK      other : error (host on_error policy)

on_error is "closed": a parse failure or crash DENIES — a raw merge slipping through a
broken guard is exactly the failure this hook exists to stop.
