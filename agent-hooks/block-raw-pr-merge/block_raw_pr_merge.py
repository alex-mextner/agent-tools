"""agents-hooks/v1 pre-bash hook — block a raw PR merge that bypasses ship.

Denies a shell command that merges a PR directly, because that skips the project's ship gate:
`gh ship <PR>` (the green-CI-gated merge + mandatory-screenshot command) is the only sanctioned
path. A raw merge lands code without the green-CI check and the required-screenshot check —
exactly the gates ship exists to enforce. The blocked routes (all when `gh` is the ACTUALLY-invoked
command) are `gh pr merge` (incl. `--admin` and a `gh -R o/r` global flag), the `gh api` REST merge
(`…/pulls/<n>/merge` with a PUT/POST method), and a `gh api graphql` merge mutation
(`mergePullRequest` / `enablePullRequestAutoMerge`). Each is also caught when hidden in a command or
process substitution — `` `…` ``, `$( … )` (even inside double quotes), `<( … )` — whose body a real
shell executes; the body is extracted and re-scanned (#248).

This is the enforcement counterpart of the doc-only "use `gh ship`, never a raw merge"
rule: advice in AGENTS.md cannot stop an autonomous (auto-mode) agent from running
`gh pr merge`, so the rule only becomes real as a mid-session guard.

Detection is ARGV-BASED, not a raw substring match.  The command is parsed via shlex
into shell segments (`;` / `&&` / `||` / `|` separated), and each segment is inspected
for `basename(argv[0])=="gh" && argv[1]=="pr" && argv[2]=="merge"` after stripping
leading inline VAR=value assignments and shell grouping tokens (`(`, `{`).  Using
basename handles path-qualified invocations (`/usr/local/bin/gh pr merge`).  This
prevents a false positive where the body of an unrelated command (e.g. `gh pr create
--body "run gh pr merge to land it"`) triggers the guard — with a raw regex that body
text would match and the command would be blocked even though no actual merge is
occurring.

Allowed (let through):
  - `gh ship <PR>` / a `gh alias` that runs ship
  - `pr-ship.sh` / `ship.sh` (the script the ship alias points at)
  - any non-merge `gh pr` subcommand (view, list, checkout, create, comment, ...)
  - a PROSE mention of "gh pr merge" as text — in an argument (`gh pr create --body "run gh
    pr merge to land it"`), a commit message, or a heredoc body — where `gh` is NOT the
    command word (argv[0]) of a segment / body line

Deliberate over-block (a rare, accepted false-positive — the SAFE direction for a security gate):
a `gh pr merge` sitting at the EXECUTABLE position (argv[0]) of a HEREDOC BODY line IS blocked,
even though a heredoc body is data, not an executed command. This is defense-in-depth: the command
parser cannot perfectly classify every shell construct, and a crafted heredoc can plant a matching
terminator to make a real merge LOOK like body text (`(( 0 << merge ))` / `gh pr merge 1` / `merge`).
Rather than chase every mis-classification, any executable-position `gh pr merge` on a skipped body
line is re-injected and blocked. A legitimate heredoc almost never opens a line with a literal
`gh pr merge`; a prose mention (gh not at argv[0]) still passes. This is a conscious divergence from
the "heredoc bodies are pure data" convention, made because the cost of a bypass here is a gate
breach and the cost of the false-positive is re-phrasing a heredoc (or using the Telegram hatch).

External approval (replaces the OLD self-service escape hatch): there is NO
`ALLOW_RAW_PR_MERGE`(+`_REASON`) env and NO `# no-ship-guard: <reason>` inline sentinel any
more — an agent could set either on its own command, so those merely let the guarded agent
grant itself the bypass this hook exists to stop. The block is now DENY-BY-DEFAULT. Use
`gh ship <PR>` (the green-CI-gated, screenshot-checked path). For a genuine one-time exception,
ASK Alex, or request a single approval by setting
`RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_BLOCK_RAW_PR_MERGE="<written justification>"`, which routes one Telegram
approval request to Alex (deny-by-default; a bare `1`/`true` is rejected). Only an approved
`tg-ctl ask` (exit 0) allows the raw merge; anything else denies.

Contract (agents-hooks/v1):
  stdin  : JSON event; the shell command is in args.command (a few fallbacks below)
  stdout : protocol JSON only
  stderr : human logs
  exit 0 : allow      exit 10 : BLOCK      other : error (host on_error policy)

on_error is "closed": a parse failure or crash DENIES — a raw merge slipping through a
broken guard is exactly the failure this hook exists to stop.

def _normalize_newlines(command: str) -> str:  # noqa: C901 — a small quote/escape/comment scanner
    r"""Remove `\`-newline line continuations (the shell joins the parts with no space) and turn
    each BARE (unquoted) newline into a `;` command separator, quote-, escape-, comment- and
    heredoc-aware.

    In a real shell a bare newline separates commands (like `;`) and a `#` comment runs only to the
    end of its LINE. shlex, fed the whole blob, instead (a) consumes a bare newline as whitespace —
    so `echo ok`+newline+`gh pr merge` collapses into one `echo`-headed segment and the merge on the
    second line evades detection — and (b) runs a `#` comment to the end of the whole INPUT once the
    newlines are gone, so a `# comment` on line 1 would swallow a merge on line 2. This pass fixes
    both BEFORE tokenizing: it drops `#` comments per-line and converts bare newlines to `;`, while
    leaving newlines/`#`/`;` that sit INSIDE quotes literal (so a two-line commit message merely
    mentioning a merge stays one quoted token and is not mis-detected).

    A `#` starts a comment ONLY at an unquoted word boundary (start, or after unescaped whitespace /
    a `;&|()` separator) — tracked by `boundary`, NOT by inspecting the last emitted char, so an
    escaped space (`echo foo\ # x`) keeps the `#` in-word and does not hide a later merge.

    Backslash escaping is honored the way the shell does: an escaped quote can't spoof quote state
    (`echo \"`+newline+`gh pr merge` runs a real merge on line 2 — `\"` is a literal `"`, not an
    opening quote). Outside quotes and inside double quotes a `\` escapes the next char (emitted
    verbatim so shlex, in posix mode, applies the same escape); inside single quotes a `\` is literal.

    Heredoc bodies (`cat <<EOF` … `EOF`) are NOT command lines, so they are skipped whole — else the
    body's newlines would become `;` separators and a `gh pr merge` mentioned in a commit-message
    heredoc would be falsely blocked. Two backstops keep that from becoming a bypass: `<<` inside an
    arithmetic context (`(( … ))` / `$(( … ))`) is a left-shift, NOT a heredoc opener (tracked by
    `arith_depth`); and any executable `gh pr merge` on a SKIPPED body line is re-injected so the
    gate still blocks (see `_skip_heredoc_bodies`), defeating a crafted `(( 0 << merge ))` / `gh pr
    merge` / `merge` that plants a matching terminator after the real merge.
