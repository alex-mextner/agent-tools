"""agents-hooks/v1 pre-write + pre-bash hook — keep the orchestrator thin.

The orchestrator plans, dispatches, and verifies — it does NOT implement inline. When the
MAIN thread is about to do implementation-shaped work itself (a non-docs code Edit/Write, or
a multi-step implementation Bash) this gate nudges it to delegate to a subagent or a
Workflow. It enforces `delegate-work-to-subagents`.

ONE script binds TWO points via two descriptors; it branches on ``event["point"]``:
  - pre-write : a CODE Edit/Write (non-docs) by the main thread → warn-then-block
  - pre-bash  : a clearly multi-step / implementation-shaped Bash by the main thread →
                warn-then-block. Read-only inspection AND sanctioned ORCHESTRATION are NEVER
                blocked — a single one-liner (git status, ls, cat, grep, find) OR a chain of any
                length whose every segment is read-only OR an orchestration command (tg, review,
                git worktree list). ALMOST ALL `gh` is DELEGATED (Alex tg#7103): CI/PR verification
                (`gh pr checks/view`, `gh run`, `gh api`) and every other gh subcommand are a
                subagent's job, not inline orchestrator work — treated as implementation and
                warn-then-block, exactly like a commit. The ONE exception, restored narrowly (Alex
                tg#9977, agent-tools#159): a genuinely UNCHAINED `gh ship <PR#>` — the gated merge
                itself as the WHOLE, sole command on the line, matched only on that exact shape (a
                bare PR-number argument, no `&&`/`;`/`||`/`|`/bare-`&`/newline anywhere on the
                line) — is sanctioned for the orchestrator to run inline, same as a subagent; every
                other gh shape, including `gh ship` with no PR number, any non-numeric argument, OR
                `gh ship <PR#>` sharing a line with ANYTHING else (even a trailing `| tail` or a
                leading `cd repo &&`), still delegates — the carve-out is a per-LINE grant, not a
                per-segment one (agent-tools#363, closing a `gh ship 205; rm -rf /`-shaped gap a
                per-segment grant left open: see `_is_unchained_gh_ship`'s own docstring). Commits/
                pushes and test runs (git commit/push, pytest, npm/bun/cargo test) are likewise
                treated as implementation and warn-then-block. A dispatched subagent (agent_id
                present) is exempt and runs gh/ship freely regardless.

                `tg` (the tg-cli Telegram reporting tool) is sanctioned for the orchestrator to run
                inline — ALL subcommands, ALL flags, AT ANY CHAIN LENGTH (Alex, direct Telegram
                authorization: "все команды tg-cli" / "ALL tg-cli commands") — this is intentionally
                BROADER than `gh ship`'s single-shape, single-segment carve-out, not the same
                treatment; see `_is_tg_command`'s own docstring for the scope this grants and why it
                stays per-segment where `gh ship` does not. This has been true since agent-tools#164;
                this revision REPLACES the old `ORCH_ALLOW` plain-regex `tg\\b` with `_is_tg_command`,
                a shlex-based predicate (bare `tg` + `VAR=val` env-prefix skip only — deliberately
                NO path-qualification, see the predicate's own docstring for why two review rounds
                landed there) that is now the SOLE authority for the tg allowance and, unlike the
                old regex, correctly rejects a hyphen-suffixed lookalike like `tg-foo`
                (agent-tools#370) — the same laundering-resistance a mutation elsewhere on the line
                still gets (head match only, never a substring/needle; chain-splitting and the
                substitution-liveness scanner still catch a mutation smuggled alongside it).

TIERED (warn → block): the FIRST offense in the TTL window WARNs (allow + message); a REPEAT
in the window BLOCKs. The tier is tracked by a marker file keyed by a hash of cwd. This gives
the doctrine's "WARN then BLOCK" instead of a hard wall on the first inline edit.

Subagent-exempt: a dispatched subagent (``agent_id`` present) does the actual work, so it is
always allowed — this gate governs the orchestrator only.

Harness-exempt (agent-tools#533): this gate's whole premise — a main thread that must delegate
implementation work to a CC ``Agent``/``Task`` subagent instead of doing it inline — is a Claude
Code concept. Codex/opencode DO model a subagent lifecycle of their own (Codex's
``SubagentStart``/``SubagentStop`` events, opencode's ``task`` tool) but NEITHER bridge exposes a
TRUSTED per-tool-call subagent identity from it today — see ``lib/codex_hook_bridge`` and
``lib/opencode_hook_bridge`` — so every Codex/opencode-sourced event used to look like "the
orchestrator" to ``_is_subagent`` — including a bare Codex CLI session Alex runs directly (which
is not a CC orchestrator refusing to delegate at all) and a Codex/opencode process spawned by
another tool as a delegated worker (review-cli's read-only reviewer backend, a CC-dispatched
subagent). Blocking either one is wrong, and the block message's remediation ("Dispatch a subagent
... Agent tool with subagent_type: 'fork'") does not even apply outside Claude Code. So a v1 event
tagged with a ``harness`` of ``codex`` or ``opencode`` specifically (set by the bridge, never by
``args`` — see ``EXEMPT_HARNESSES``) is exempt from this gate entirely, same as a dispatched
subagent. Deliberately an ALLOWLIST of the two known-safe values, not "any non-CC harness": a
future bridge (``HARNESS = "gemini"``, say) is UNPROVEN here and stays governed until someone
reviews and adds it — a present-but-unrecognized value is not automatically evidence the gate's
CC-specific premise doesn't apply to it, only that nobody has confirmed that yet. If a
Codex/opencode session is ever meant to BE the thin orchestrator in someone's setup, that needs an
explicit config knob, not a change to this hardcoded exemption.

Per-repo opt-out (Alex tg#5743): default ON; a repo that legitimately works inline on main
(e.g. 3d-cli) sets `agent_hooks.orchestrator_only: false` in its rig.yaml, or exports
RIG_ORCHESTRATOR_ONLY=0. Default ON means an un-enrolled repo keeps the current always-on
behavior (no regression). Mirrors the opt-IN worktree-only-writes guard's per-repo knob.

External approval (deny-by-default): there is NO self-service bypass. For a genuine exception,
ASK the human, or request a one-time Telegram approval by setting
`RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_ORCHESTRATOR_STAYS_THIN="<written justification>"` — when the tiered guard
would BLOCK (a REPEAT offense), the hook asks via a trusted `tg-ctl` and allows ONLY on an
explicit approval tap. A blank value or a bare `1`/`true` is rejected (deny), no Telegram call
is made. An agent can request, not self-grant — the human decides. (This is distinct from the
per-repo ENABLE knob RIG_ORCHESTRATOR_ONLY / agent_hooks.orchestrator_only, which a repo owner,
not the constrained agent, sets to opt a repo out entirely.)

Contract (agents-hooks/v1):
  stdin  : JSON event; args.command (bash) or args.file_path/path (write); event.point
  stdout : protocol JSON only       exit 0 : allow   exit 10 : BLOCK   other : error

on_error is "open": delegation discipline, not a security boundary — a crash must never wedge
the main thread's ability to act.

#
# `gh` IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT from THIS head-only regex (Alex tg#7103: revert the #159/#162 gh-ship
# carve-out). The orchestrator delegates almost all `gh` to a subagent — CI/PR verification (`gh pr
# checks/view`, `gh run`, `gh api`) and every other subcommand are a subagent's job, not inline
# orchestrator work. `gh` is instead an implementation signal by default (`_is_gh_command`, defined
# with the other head-normalization helpers), so a generic gh invocation warn-then-blocks for the
# orchestrator exactly like `git commit`. `gh` delegation subsumes the old `gh api` GET-vs-mutation
# distinction: it no longer matters whether a gh call reads or writes; the orchestrator runs no gh
# (except the one exception below). A dispatched subagent (`agent_id` present) is exempt and runs gh
# freely regardless — the gate governs the orchestrator only.
#
# ONE narrow exception, restored (Alex tg#9977, agent-tools#159): a genuinely UNCHAINED
# `gh ship <PR#>` — the WHOLE, sole command on the line — is sanctioned for the orchestrator to run
# inline. It is NOT added to this head-only regex (ORCH_ALLOW has no argument awareness — it cannot
# tell `gh ship 605` from `gh ship` or `gh pr merge`); instead it is its own shlex-based predicate,
# `_is_gh_ship_command`, consulted ONLY by the top-level, whole-LINE `_is_unchained_gh_ship` (NOT by
# `_seg_is_allowed`/`_seg_is_impl_signal` — agent-tools#363 moved it out of those two per-segment
# predicates after a per-segment grant let `gh ship 205; rm -rf /` slip through unblocked; see
# `_is_unchained_gh_ship`'s own docstring for the full story). Every OTHER gh shape — `gh ship` with
# no PR number, `gh pr merge`, `gh run`, `gh pr checks/view`, `gh api`, AND `gh ship <PR#>` chained
# with anything else at all, even a trailing `| tail` — still delegates.
#
# `tg` is DELIBERATELY ABSENT from THIS head-only regex (moved out, tg-carveout-159, Fable review
# round 3): it used to live here as a plain `tg\b` since agent-tools#164, but a plain regex has no
# argument-position awareness and — worse — its `\b` boundary also matches a hyphen-suffixed
# lookalike (`tg-foo`, agent-tools#370). ALL tg-cli commands (Alex, direct Telegram authorization:
# "все команды tg-cli" / "ALL tg-cli commands", explicitly broader than `gh ship`'s single-shape,
# single-segment carve-out — `tg` stays sanctioned at ANY chain length, `gh ship` only when
# unchained) are instead sanctioned by `_is_tg_command`, its own shlex-based predicate (defined with
# the other head-normalization helpers), consulted directly by `_seg_is_allowed` (per-segment, same
# as before) — the SOLE authority for "is this segment `tg`", not a redundant addition alongside a
# regex. `review\b`/`git worktree list` remain here unchanged; `review\b` has the SAME `\b`-boundary

# INTENTIONAL, jointly-accepted operating model — not friction an agent should route around. The
# orchestrator plans and dispatches; a subagent does the implementation-shaped work (an edit, a
# build, a raw `git commit`/`git push`, a test run — AND nearly all `gh`, including CI/PR
# verification). A prior draft framed this as a terse rule ("does not implement inline") that read
# as adversarial and invited unwanted workarounds. The message now states WHY (the agreed model,
# not an error), HOW to proceed (dispatch a subagent), and that fighting it is out of scope. The
# `gh ship` / read-only-`gh` carve-out (agent-tools#159/#162) was REMOVED here per tg#7103
# (shipping and CI verification were both delegated), then PARTIALLY RESTORED (Alex tg#9977,
# agent-tools#159): narrowly, an UNCHAINED `gh ship <PR#>` only (agent-tools#363 narrowed this
# further to a per-LINE grant — see `_is_unchained_gh_ship`). The orchestrator may run that one
# exact, unchained shape inline again, same as a subagent ("the orchestrator CAN gh ship like
# agents can, but BY DEFAULT agents do it"); CI/PR verification, every other gh subcommand, and a
# `gh ship <PR#>` chained with anything else all stay delegated, so this MESSAGE still fires for

    agent cannot forge it.

    We deliberately DO NOT fall back to a top-level `event.get("agent_id")`: the bridge NEVER
    writes a top-level `agent_id` (its v1 event has no such key), so that fallback was a DEAD path
    that was nonetheless a TRUSTED, unsanitized relax-surface — if any non-bridge producer ever set
    a top-level agent_id from a model-influenced field, the orchestrator would self-exempt. This
    narrows the read to the sanitized `args.agent_id` only, matching the sibling skills-read-gate

def _split_chain(command: str) -> list[str]:
    """Split a command into segments on shell operators (``&&`` ``||`` ``;`` ``|`` newline AND a
    bare control ``&``) that lie OUTSIDE quotes. Quote-aware so a ``|`` inside a quoted jq program
    (``jq '.a | .b'``) is NOT a split point — that mis-split used to flap a read chain (codex).

    A bare ``&`` (backgrounding) IS a real segment separator, so `tg done & git commit` splits into
    two segments and the smuggled `git commit` is judged on its own — without this it was one
    segment with a benign `tg` head and slipped past the impl scan (codex review). A redirect ``&``
    (`2>&1`, `&>`, `>&`) and the already-handled `&&` are NOT splits (BG_AMP semantics).

    A BACKSLASH-ESCAPED quote character OUTSIDE single quotes does NOT open/close a quoted span —
    e.g. ``gh ship 605 \\' ; rm -rf /`` (agent-tools#363, Fable review round 3): bash treats a
    lone ``\\'`` outside quotes as a literal apostrophe, so the ``;`` that follows is a REAL,
    unescaped command separator (confirmed against `shlex.split`, which treats it identically —
    the trailing tokens are `["'", ";", "rm", "-rf", "/"]`, not a quoted span swallowing them). The
    PRE-fix version of this function had no backslash awareness at all: it saw the bare ``\\'`` as
    an ordinary character followed by a real quote-OPEN, entered quote mode, and then swallowed
    the genuine ``;``/`` rm -rf /`` into the SAME segment as `gh ship 605` — i.e. `_split_chain`
    itself, not just `_is_unchained_gh_ship`, was fooled into reporting ONE segment for a line
    that bash actually runs as TWO commands. Since `_is_unchained_gh_ship`'s whole security
    guarantee rests on `_split_chain` finding EVERY real separator, this was a live bypass of the
    ship carve-out via a single escaped quote character, independent of the substitution veto.
    Handling: a `\\` immediately followed by another character, seen OUTSIDE an open single-quoted
    span, consumes BOTH characters as one literal unit without toggling `quote` — matching bash's
    actual escape semantics closely enough to prevent this class of quote-state confusion (inside
    an OPEN single-quoted span a backslash has no special meaning at all in real bash either, so
    that case is deliberately excluded — see the `quote != "'"` guard below). Full generalized
    shell-escaping (ANSI-C `$'...'` quoting, `\\n` sequences, etc.) remains out of scope — a
    discipline heuristic, not a full shell parser — but the specific "escaped quote hides a real
    separator" class is now closed for both this function and `_blank_single_quoted` (SYNC:
    the two functions intentionally share this exact backslash-handling shape).

    `prev_escaped` guards a SECOND bug the backslash fix above introduced on its own (Opus + Fable
    review round 4 of #363, both independently caught it — the round-3 fix regressed this):
    consuming `\\&` as one literal unit leaves a genuinely UNESCAPED, standalone `&` immediately
    after it — e.g. `gh ship 605 \\&& rm -rf /`, which real bash parses as `gh ship 605 &`
    (backgrounded — confirmed against `bash -x`) followed by a separate `rm -rf /`. The bare-`&`
    check below excludes a `&` whose `prev` char is also `&` (so it doesn't re-split the second
    half of an already-consumed `&&`, or misread `2>&1`/`&>` redirects) — but `prev` here was
    computed from the RAW string, so the just-escaped `&` (now sitting in `buf`, not a real
    adjacent operator character from bash's point of view) wrongly satisfied that exclusion,
    swallowing the genuine standalone `&` into the SAME segment and re-opening exactly the class
    of bypass round 3 closed. `prev_escaped` tracks whether the char immediately behind the cursor
    was consumed as an ESCAPED target (not a real, independently-meaningful operator char), and
    forces `prev` to a neutral empty string in that case, so the following operator char is judged
    on its own merits."""

    SEMANTICS (#164 review P2): inside single quotes everything is literal — a `tg 'saw $(x)'` is
    text, blank it. Inside DOUBLE quotes `$(…)` and backticks still EXECUTE, so double-quoted
    content is kept INTACT for the scan — `gh ship "$(gh api … -X POST)"` must have its inner
    command extracted and judged, not erased. (An earlier version blanked both quote kinds, which
    erased exactly the common quoted-mutation form.) Conservative side effect: a literal `<(…)`
    inside double quotes (where process substitution does NOT execute) is still extracted and may
    over-flag — the safe direction for a gate.

    A BACKSLASH-ESCAPED quote character OUTSIDE single quotes does NOT open/close a span (Opus +
    Fable review round 2/3 of #363): `gh ship 605 "it's $(rm -rf /)"` and
    `gh ship 605 --note \\' $(rm -rf /)` were BOTH concrete bypasses of an earlier version of this

    since this function only tracks ONE quote type at a time and never blanks double-quoted
    content, but the SAME naive-toggle class of bug DID bite `\\'` outside any quotes: it opened
    phantom single-quote blanking, erasing the live `$(rm -rf /)` that follows and hiding it from

    the two functions share this exact shape): a `\\` immediately followed by another character,

    toggling `quote` — so an escaped quote can never masquerade as a real one. Inside an OPEN

def _seg_is_allowed(segment: str) -> bool:

    Head-anchored, so a build/edit token appearing only as an ARGUMENT/needle (`cat tee.log`,
    `git log | rg gh`) stays allowed on its real head, not the needle (the anchor invariant, #5/#80).
    `gh` (ANY subcommand, INCLUDING `ship`) is NOT allowed here — it is delegated (`_is_gh_command`);
    this predicate covers `review`/`git worktree list` (via `ORCH_ALLOW`), `tg` (via its own
    shlex-based `_is_tg_command`), read-only inspection, and the `cd` companion.

    `gh ship <PR#>` is DELIBERATELY ABSENT from this per-segment allow-list (agent-tools#363,
    reverting a #159/#162 regression): the ship carve-out is granted ONLY by
    `_is_unchained_gh_ship` at the whole-LINE level, in `_is_all_inline_allowed`, for a genuinely
    single-segment `gh ship <PR#>` command — never per-segment here. A prior revision consulted
    `_is_gh_ship_command` directly in this OR-chain, which made EVERY segment matching the ship
    shape allowed regardless of chain position; combined with `_seg_is_impl_signal`'s matching
    per-segment exception, that let `gh ship 205; rm -rf /` (or any companion this file has no
    named pattern for — `chmod`, `scp`, `mv`, `dd`, …) sail through silently: the ship segment
    passed the allow-list, the unrecognized companion matched no impl-signal regex either, and a
    2-segment chain doesn't reach the `>= 3` chain-length fallback. Reverting to a per-LINE grant
    closes that gap: the moment `gh ship <PR#>` sits in ANY multi-segment chain, `_seg_is_allowed`
    denies it here exactly as it denies any other `gh` subcommand, so the chain is judged on its
    OTHER segments' own merits (or the `_seg_is_impl_signal` trip below), not waved through by a
    recognized-pattern allow-list that cannot enumerate every possible mutation.

    A benign head does NOT launder a mutation the head-anchor cannot see: find's mutating primaries
    (delete/exec/file-write) and a `git branch` WITH an argument (its `-D`/create forms) are a read
    head that carries a write, so they forfeit the allow-list (agent-tools#159). `cd` (no repo
    state) is an allowed companion so `cd <repo> && tg 'done' | tail` stays an orchestration chain.

    Deliberately NOT gated on `BUILD_EDIT`/other impl-signal regexes THIS FUNCTION DOESN'T ITSELF
    ENFORCE: a sanctioned head/shape (`tg`, `review`, …) is allowed here even when its OWN argument
    TEXT happens to match a mutation-shaped regex this predicate has no explicit veto for (`tg 'saw
    $(git push) in logs'` — `BUILD_EDIT` is never checked by THIS function at all) — that contract
    is "does this segment's HEAD/SHAPE look sanctioned", not "does this segment's text contain no
    mutation-shaped substring anywhere THIS FUNCTION SCANS FOR". It is NOT a blanket "sanctioned
    shape always wins": the two vetoes THIS FUNCTION DOES check (`FIND_MUTATION`, `git branch
    <arg>`) still forfeit the allow-list even for an otherwise-sanctioned segment. For genuine
    mutations THIS function has no veto for at all, the REAL protection is elsewhere and

    exception actually applies. See that function's docstring for why a per-segment consultation of
    THIS predicate alone used to be the security gap.

    Anything AFTER the PR number — flags (`--screenshot`, `--repo`, even `--skip-ci`), a trailing
    redirect token (`2>&1`) — is unrestricted: this predicate recognizes the ship *shape* only and
    does not vet ship's own flags. `--skip-ci` in particular has its OWN separate,
    independently-gated live-Telegram hatch inside `ci/ship/ship.sh` (`RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_SHIP_SKIP_CI`)
    that this gate does not duplicate — an inline `gh ship 605 --skip-ci` passes THIS gate the same
    as any other ship, and ship.sh's own gate is the sole control on the skip-ci bypass itself.

    Basename/env-prefix normalization intentionally mirrors `_is_gh_command`'s DENY-side behavior
    reused on the ALLOW side (Fable review flagged the asymmetry: a deny-side conservatism becomes
    permissive when reused for a grant, e.g. a `gh` binary at a nonstandard path or under an
    unrelated env-prefix also qualifies). Accepted as consistent with this module's stated threat
    model — a cooperative orchestrator, not an adversarial one; `on_error: open` and the whole gate
    are discipline, not a security boundary (see the module docstring) — rather than diverging the
    two predicates' head-matching and risking the drift this shared helper exists to prevent.

    On an UNPARSEABLE (unbalanced-quote) segment, shlex raises — return False (not recognized as
    ship) rather than guessing, so the segment falls through to `_is_gh_command`'s OWN conservative
    head-regex fallback and stays delegated. This is the mirror image of `_is_gh_command`'s own
    unbalanced-quote fallback (which blocks): the safe default for GRANTING an allowance is "no
    match", while the safe default for a DENY is "match" — same direction of caution, opposite
    boolean outcome."""

def _is_unchained_gh_ship(command: str) -> bool:
    """True when the ENTIRE command line — including any TRAILING separator, not only an internal
    one — is free of `&&`/`||`/`;`/`|`/bare-`&`/newline, free of a heredoc, and free of a LIVE
    substitution, whose (wrapper-stripped) content is exactly `gh ship <PR#>`
    (`_is_gh_ship_command`). THE sole grant point for the ship carve-out (agent-tools#363): a
    per-LINE grant for a genuinely unchained, single-purpose invocation, not a per-segment one.

    This is deliberately a top-level, whole-command check rather than something `_seg_is_allowed`/
    `_seg_is_impl_signal` decide per segment. The PRIOR design (agent-tools#159/#162, restored)
    wired the ship exception into those two per-segment predicates directly, which made EVERY
    segment matching the ship shape exempt regardless of where it sat in a chain — so `gh ship
    205; rm -rf /` passed silently: the ship segment was allowed, `rm -rf /` matched no impl-signal
    regex this file recognizes (BUILD_EDIT/uv-test/git-python-impl/dev/gh are all narrow,
    named-pattern lists — they cannot enumerate every destructive command), and a 2-segment chain
    never reaches the `>= 3` chain-length fallback. Gating the grant on "is this line free of every
    separator" closes THAT specific hole — a `gh ship <PR#>` sharing a line with anything else,
    even a single trailing `| tail` or a leading `cd repo &&`, returns False here, `gh` reverts to
    being an ordinary (still-delegated) impl-signal via `_seg_is_impl_signal`, and the WHOLE line
    is judged by the pre-#159 rules: a `gh` segment anywhere trips it, independent of what the
    other segments are or whether THEY happen to match a recognized mutation pattern. It does NOT
    close the broader, pre-existing "an unrecognized head with no impl-signal in a <3-segment
    chain silently falls through to allowed" behavior that this whole file has always had for
    every OTHER sanctioned head (`tg`, `review`, read-only inspection) — see the module's own
    per-segment allow-list docs and the README's "Known, PRE-EXISTING gap" note for that boundary;
    fixing it is a separate, unscoped change this PR deliberately does not make (Fable review,
    round 2: an earlier draft of this docstring said the fix closes the gap "unconditionally",
    which overstated it — it closes it for lines a `gh ship` grant would otherwise have waved
    through, not for the file's fall-through-to-allowed default in general).

    SELF-CONTAINED on HEREDOC/substitution, not delegated to caller discipline (Opus + Fable
    review, round 2 of #363): an earlier revision relied on `_is_all_inline_allowed` checking
    `HEREDOC`/`_has_mutating_substitution` BEFORE ever consulting this function, documented only
    as a "callers MUST" docstring warning. That left an identical hole ONE LEVEL DOWN from the
    chain-operator gap this function exists to close: `gh ship 605 $(rm -rf /)` is a single
    segment (`_split_chain` sees no `;`/`&&`/…), so it reached this function; `_is_gh_ship_command`
    matches (`605` is clean, everything after — including the whole `$(rm -rf /)` token — is
    unrestricted trailing text by design); and `_has_mutating_substitution`'s OWN narrow-pattern
    scan does not recognize `rm -rf /` as a mutation any more than `_seg_is_impl_signal` recognizes
    it chained — the exact same "unenumerable companion" flaw, reached via `$()` instead of `;`.
    Rather than trying to enumerate every destructive command a substitution could carry (the
    unenumerable-list problem this whole fix exists to get away from), this function now refuses
    the grant on ANY live substitution marker at all — `$(`, a backtick, `<(`, or `>(` (process
    substitution executes too, same as command substitution) — found OUTSIDE single quotes
    (scanned via `SUBSTITUTION` against the single-quote-blanked command, the same quote-semantics
    `_substitution_inners` uses: a literal `$(...)` inside single quotes never executes and does
    not disqualify the grant, e.g. `gh ship 605 --note 'ran $(build) earlier'` stays allowed; a
    live one inside DOUBLE quotes still executes and IS caught, including when an unrelated
    apostrophe sits inside the same double-quoted span, e.g. `gh ship 605 "it's $(rm -rf /)"` —
    `_blank_single_quoted` only enters blanking mode on a `'` seen OUTSIDE an open `"..."` span, so
    the apostrophe here never toggles quote state and the live `$(...)` stays visible to the scan).
    This also makes the function itself the sole, self-contained authority its docstring already
    claimed it was — a future caller that consults it directly, without first replicating
    `_is_all_inline_allowed`'s HEREDOC/substitution ordering, gets the same safe answer, instead of
    silently reopening this class of gap.

    TRAILING separators disqualify too, not only internal ones (Fable review, round 2): a bare
    `gh ship 605;` or `gh ship 605 &` has no companion command after the separator, so
    `_split_chain` drops the resulting empty segment and `len(segs) == 1` alone would still call
    it unchained — contradicting this docstring's own "no separator anywhere" contract and, worse,
    silently BACKGROUNDING the sanctioned merge for the trailing-`&` case (the orchestrator would
    lose the synchronous exit status of the one mutation it is allowed to run inline — the same
    backgrounding concern the sibling `subagent-no-bg-longproc` hook polices elsewhere). Checking
    `segs[0] == command` (not just `len(segs) == 1`) catches this: `_split_chain` only returns the
    ORIGINAL string unchanged, byte-for-byte, when it found zero separators to split on; any real
    separator — leading, trailing, or internal — changes what comes back, even after empty-segment
    filtering collapses the segment COUNT back down to one."""

def _is_tg_command(segment: str) -> bool:
    """True when a segment's COMMAND head is `tg` (the tg-cli Telegram reporting tool) — ANY
    subcommand, ANY flag combination is sanctioned: plain text, `--file`, `--photo`, `--format
    html`, `--tag`, `--reply-to`, `voice setup`, and everything else tg-cli exposes. Authorized
    explicitly and broadly by Alex (Telegram, direct reply, this thread): "оркестратор ещё и tg:*
    должен уметь, т.е. все команды tg-cli" — "the orchestrator should ALSO be able to run tg:*,
    i.e. ALL tg-cli commands". Unlike `gh ship <PR#>`'s PR-number-shape narrowing, this predicate
    does NOT narrow by subcommand or argument position: tg is a leaf reporting/notification tool
    with no subcommand this gate has reason to withhold from the orchestrator.

    THE SOLE authority for "is this segment `tg`" (tg-carveout-159, Fable review round 3) —
    `ORCH_ALLOW` used to carry a plain `tg\\b` regex alternative for this (agent-tools#164); that
    regex is now REMOVED from `ORCH_ALLOW` and this predicate replaces it outright, not sitting
    alongside it as a redundant addition (an earlier draft of this PR kept both — Fable correctly
    flagged that `ORCH_ALLOW` being checked FIRST in `_seg_is_allowed`'s OR-chain made this
    predicate unreachable dead code end-to-end, since the plain regex matched a strict superset of
    what it could ever grant). Consolidating ALSO fixes agent-tools#370 for the `tg` case: `\\b` is
    a WORD-boundary, which also fires before a hyphen, so the old regex incorrectly matched
    `tg-foo` too — this predicate's basename-EXACT token check (`toks[i] == "tg"`) does not have
    that quirk, and now that it is the only gate, `tg-foo` is correctly rejected end-to-end (see
    `test_tg_foo_is_now_rejected_end_to_end`, which supersedes the pinned-quirk test an earlier
    draft had). `review`'s matching `\\b` quirk (`review-foo`) is UNCHANGED and out of scope here —
    the surviving half of agent-tools#370.

    shlex-based, with a self-contained `VAR=val` env-prefix skip (matching `_is_gh_command`'s own
    precedent, so a caller that invokes this predicate directly, without going through
    `_strip_wrappers` first, still classifies `TG_BOT_TOKEN=x tg 'msg'` correctly).

    **Deliberately NO path-qualification** (`/opt/homebrew/bin/tg`), despite `_is_gh_command`
    accepting any path — resolved across two review rounds, not shipped as a guess. `_is_gh_command`
    is a DENY-direction predicate (over-matching there only routes more things to a subagent, the
    safe failure mode); this predicate is GRANT-direction (a match means "never even warn"), so the
    same blanket path normalization would over-match in the UNSAFE direction — a relative path
    (`./tg`) is trivial to place anywhere near the working directory, and narrowing to "absolute
    paths only" does not actually narrow anything real (`/tmp/tg` is just as easy to write as
    `./tg` — disproved empirically in round 2). A hardcoded bin-dir allowlist was also rejected: it
    would be unreliable in practice (this predicate's own authoring machine resolves its real `tg`
    to a non-standard, dotfiles-managed path, not any short "standard" list). Given this gate's own
    stated threat model (discipline, not a security boundary — see the module docstring's
    "Fail-open, on purpose") and that the practical need (Alex's ask) is fully met by subcommand
    breadth alone, path-qualification was dropped entirely.

    Deliberately does NOT exclude argument text that happens to look like a mutation (`tg 'ran
    sed -i on it'`) — the SAME "sanctioned shape wins over argument text this function doesn't scan
    for" precedent `review` already has (see `_seg_is_allowed`'s own docstring). `gh ship <PR#>`
    used to share this exact per-segment precedent too (agent-tools#159), but agent-tools#363 moved
    its grant to the whole-LINE `_is_unchained_gh_ship` instead — see
    `test_incidental_mutation_shaped_text_in_a_ship_segment_matches_tg_precedent`, which still pins
    the `gh ship` case but now documents the DIFFERENT (line-level, not segment-level) mechanism
    that grants it. The real protection against a genuine mutation is unconditional and elsewhere:
    chain-splitting (a real `&&`/`;`/`|`/bare-`&` makes it a SEPARATE segment) and the
    substitution-liveness scanner (a LIVE `$()`/backtick/`<()`/`>()` executes and is caught
    regardless of what this predicate says about the outer segment).

    On an UNPARSEABLE (unbalanced-quote) segment, shlex raises — return `False`, mirroring
    `_is_gh_ship_command`'s conservative-fallback DIRECTION (deny-by-default; a discipline gate
    should not grant on an input it cannot confidently classify), NOT the old regex's "recognize
    it anyway" fallback. That old direction was justified ONLY by parity with the (now-removed)
    `tg\\b` regex, which had no notion of "unparseable" at all; now that this predicate is the sole
    authority rather than a redundant addition, the parity argument no longer applies, and the safe
    default for a GRANT-direction predicate facing uncertain input is to not grant (Opus/Fable
    round 3: decide the fallback direction on its own merits once the predicate is load-bearing,
    not by inheriting an old regex's behavior)."""

    The superset used to decide "not implementation": a chain of only `gh pr list`/`tg`/… (or
    read-only inspection) is orchestration, never blocked. The flapping fix (Alex tg#5743 /
    agent-tools#23).

    Rejects a chain whose substitution smuggles a MUTATION (`tg done $(gh api -X POST …)`) — the
    head-anchored allow check cannot see inside `$(…)`, so this is the only place to catch it before
    the fast path returns. A BENIGN substitution (`cat $(find …) | grep | head`) is NOT rejected, so
    the #80 read-only-pipe-of-any-length invariant holds (agent-tools#159, Opus review). A bare `&`
    is handled by `_split_chain` splitting it, so its segments are judged individually.

    The `_is_unchained_gh_ship` check sits AFTER these two vetoes, but — unlike an earlier revision
    of this comment claimed — that ordering is no longer LOAD-BEARING (Fable review, round 2 of
    #363): `_is_unchained_gh_ship` is now self-contained and independently refuses HEREDOC and any
    live substitution itself (see its own docstring), so `gh ship 605 $(sed -i x)` is caught either
    way — by this function's own veto above, OR by `_is_unchained_gh_ship`'s internal one, should a
    future edit ever reorder these three checks. The ordering here is kept for readability (vetoes
    before grants) and as defense-in-depth, not because correctness depends on it.

    NOT a "does this line contain at least one orchestration head" check (tg-carveout-159, Opus +
    Fable review round 4 both independently misread it that way): `all(_seg_is_allowed(s) for s in
    segs)` is a per-segment universal check with no minimum-count or specific-source requirement —
    a chain whose ONLY orchestration head is `_is_tg_command`-matched (not `ORCH_ALLOW`-matched),
    or a chain that is PURELY read-only with zero orchestration heads at all, both satisfy this the
    SAME way. Moving `tg` out of `ORCH_ALLOW` and into its own predicate therefore does not change
    which chains get the any-length exemption — every `_seg_is_allowed` source (`READ_ONLY_BASH`,
    `ORCH_ALLOW`, `_is_tg_command`, `_dev_segment_is_allowed`, `CD_HEAD`) contributes equally to
    this `all(...)`. `gh ship <PR#>` is deliberately NOT one of those sources any more
    (agent-tools#363) — it is granted only by the separate `_is_unchained_gh_ship` check below,
    which is per-LINE, not per-segment; see that function's own docstring for why.
