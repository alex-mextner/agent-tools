# Agent hooks (`agents-hooks/v1`)

Agent hooks are **out-of-process guards that fire on an agent's tool use** and decide
whether the action is allowed. Unlike a git hook (which fires at commit/push time), an
agent hook catches the action *mid-session* — the moment the agent tries to run a command,
write a file, or finish a turn. That makes them the right place for rules that must be
enforced *before* the side effect happens, not after.

Each hook here is a self-contained directory:

```
<hook-name>/
  <id>.<point>.json   # the descriptor — what to run and when
  <script>            # the executable the descriptor points at
  README.md           # what it does, how to install, fail policy
```

## The contract (`agents-hooks/v1`)

A host (the agent harness, or a tool like a CLI) runs the hook executable and speaks a
tiny JSON-on-stdin / exit-code protocol. No shared runtime between host and hook.

- **stdin**: a JSON event — `{ hook_api, event_id, tool, point, command, cwd, args }`.
  `args` carries the action-specific payload (e.g. the Bash command string, the file path
  + content for a write).
- **stdout**: protocol JSON only — `{ "hook_api": "agents-hooks/v1", "decision": "allow"
  | "block", "message": "..." }`. Empty stdout = allow.
- **stderr**: human logs (never parsed).
- **exit code is the canonical signal:**
  - `0` → allow
  - `10` → **BLOCK** (un-corruptible: exit 10 blocks even if stdout is malformed, so a
    broken gate can never silently let an action through)
  - any other exit → hook *error*, resolved by the descriptor's `on_error` policy.

## Fail policy: `on_error`

- `on_error: "open"` (default) — a hook crash/timeout/bad-output **warns and proceeds**.
  Use for advisory hooks that must never break the agent's flow.
- `on_error: "closed"` — a hook error **blocks** the action. Use for security gates where
  "I couldn't check" must mean "don't do it".

## Descriptor fields

```jsonc
{
  "id": "block-no-verify",          // stable id; [A-Za-z0-9._-]
  "point": "pre-bash",              // the host hook point this binds to
  "cmd": "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/script",// MUST be absolute (the runner rejects relative/bare)
  "args": [],                       // extra argv before the JSON protocol (rare)
  "priority": 50,                   // lower runs first; default 50
  "timeout_ms": 5000,               // per-hook timeout; default 5000
  "on_error": "closed",            // "open" (default) | "closed"
  "description": "..."
}
```

> **`cmd` must be an absolute path.** The runner hashes the file at `cmd` but spawns it,
> and a bare/relative command would let the executed bytes differ from the hashed bytes.
> Installers substitute the real absolute path at install time; the descriptors here ship
> a `/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/...` placeholder.

## Hook points used here

These are the *logical* points; map them to your harness's actual tool-use events
(e.g. a PreToolUse matcher on the Bash/Write/Edit tool, or a Stop hook).

| point          | fires when…                                  | hooks                                   |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `pre-bash`     | before a shell command runs                  | block-no-verify, block-raw-pr-merge, require-review-before-commit, enforce-timeout-on-bash |
| `pre-write`    | before a file write/edit                     | block-secrets-write, block-raw-process-env |
| `stop`         | when the agent is about to end its turn      | stop-completion-selfcheck               |

## Installing

1. Edit the descriptor's `cmd` to the absolute path of the script (and `chmod +x` it).
2. Drop the descriptor into your harness's hook directory for the matching point.
3. Map the logical `point` to your harness's real event if its names differ.

Security note: a descriptor names an executable the host runs on every matching action.
Only you (or your own tooling) should write to the hook directory.

## Carrier choice

These are *agent* hooks specifically because they must intercept the action **mid-session**
— a git hook can't block a `--no-verify` commit (it's the very thing being skipped) and
can't stop a secret from being *written to a file* before the commit. See
`../docs/carrier-decision-guide.md` for when a rule belongs in a skill vs an agent-hook vs
a git-hook.
