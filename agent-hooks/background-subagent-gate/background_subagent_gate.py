"""agents-hooks/v1 pre-agent hook — push non-trivial subagent dispatches to the background.

Fires when the MAIN thread is about to dispatch a subagent (the CC `Agent`/`Task` tool).
A non-trivial subagent run in the FOREGROUND blocks the orchestrator until it finishes —
which defeats the whole point of fanning work out. This gate blocks such a foreground
dispatch and tells the orchestrator to dispatch it as a `fork`, `isolation: "remote"`, or a
dynamic Workflow instead. It enforces the orchestration half of `delegate-work-to-subagents`.

Allowed (let through):
  - ``subagent_type: "fork"`` — CC's own `Agent` tool description states a fork "runs in the
    background... you get a completion notification", so it is inherently the desired shape
  - ``isolation: "remote"`` — CC's own tool description states this "always runs in
    background"
  - a dispatch already marked ``run_in_background: true`` — dead on CC (see NOTE below), and
    NOT a signal a default opencode build can produce either: opencode 1.18.20's task tool
    advertises only description/prompt/subagent_type/task_id/command (no background field).
    Its native ``background`` boolean exists ONLY behind the experimental runtime flag
    ``OPENCODE_EXPERIMENTAL_BACKGROUND_SUBAGENTS=true``, and the bridge
    (`lib/opencode_hook_bridge/dispatch.py`) maps that field into ``run_in_background`` only
    when the hosting opencode process carries the flag — so this allow path is live exactly
    when opencode would actually honor it. For a default opencode build the sanctioned
    background mechanism is the canonical detached launcher provisioned from the
    `rig-detached-opencode` universal skill to
    ``~/.agents/skills/rig-detached-opencode/rig-detached-opencode`` (the default
    skills_target — a machine that customizes it sees its own target in ``rig status``;
    `bin/` is not a rig-discovered carrier, so the REMINDER must name the provisioned
    skill copy)
    (RIG_AGENT_ID/RIG_DETACHED_AGENT markers -> bridge injects agent_id -> the detached
    child session is subagent-exempt, not a foreground dispatch at all)
  - a TRIVIAL one-liner dispatch (short, single-line prompt) — cheap enough to run inline
  - a dispatch made BY a subagent itself (subagent-exempt: ``agent_id`` present) — a subagent
    may fan out further, and this gate governs the orchestrator, not the workers

NOTE (CC-specific): as of CC 2.1.177 the `Agent` tool's JSON schema carries no
`run_in_background` property at all (only `description`, `isolation`, `model`, `prompt`,
`subagent_type`) — under schema-constrained tool calling the model cannot produce that field,
so treating it as the ONLY non-trivial allow path hard-blocked every fork/remote dispatch with
no way through short of a Telegram hatch call every single time. Recognizing
`subagent_type: "fork"` and `isolation: "remote"` — the two shapes CC's own docs already
guarantee run in the background — is what actually satisfies this hook's intent instead.

External approval (deny-by-default): there is NO self-service bypass. For a genuine exception,
ASK the human, or request a one-time Telegram approval by setting
`RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_BACKGROUND_SUBAGENT_GATE="<written justification>"` — the hook asks via a
trusted `tg-ctl` and allows ONLY on an explicit approval tap. A blank value or a bare `1`/`true`
is rejected (deny), and no Telegram call is made. An agent setting its own env var can request,
not self-grant — the human decides.

Contract (agents-hooks/v1):
  stdin  : JSON event; the dispatch payload is in args (subagent_type, isolation, prompt,
           description, run_in_background)
  stdout : protocol JSON only       exit 0 : allow   exit 10 : BLOCK   other : error

on_error is "open": this is an orchestration-discipline boundary, not a security gate — a
crash here must never wedge the ability to dispatch work.
