# skills-marker-writer

**Point:** `pre-skill` · **Fail policy:** `open` · **Priority:** 50

Touches `~/.cache/agent-tools/skills-invoked/<session-id>/<skill-name>` on every Skill-tool
invocation. This is the wrapper `skills-read-gate` has always needed: that gate blocks/warns
on work-shaped actions unless the mandatory skills were invoked recently, deciding "recently"
by checking mtime freshness on exactly this marker. Before this hook existed, nothing ever
wrote the marker, so the freshness check always saw a missing file and the gate could never
leave its WARN-forever tier — see `agent-hooks/skills-read-gate/README.md`.

## What it does

On a `Skill`-tool `PreToolUse` event, reads the invoked skill name from `args.skill` and the
CC session id from `args.session_id`, then:

```bash
mkdir -p "${SKILLS_INVOKED_DIR:-$HOME/.cache/agent-tools/skills-invoked}/<session-id>"
touch "${SKILLS_INVOKED_DIR:-$HOME/.cache/agent-tools/skills-invoked}/<session-id>/<skill-name>"
```

Session-scoping the marker matters: without it, one shared mtime file per skill means any
Claude Code session on the machine invoking a mandatory skill silently satisfies every OTHER
concurrent session's freshness check too, even though that other session never read it.
`args.session_id` is CC's own session id, forwarded with the same T2 precedence as
`agent_id` in `lib/cc_hook_bridge/dispatch.py` — a value riding in via `tool_input` cannot
spoof it. When no valid session id is present on the event (a non-CC harness, a hermetic
test), the marker falls back to the pre-session-scoping global path.

(`Path.touch(exist_ok=True)` on an already-existing file already bumps its mtime — that IS
the freshness update the marker contract needs, no extra step required.)

`SKILLS_INVOKED_DIR` is the same env var `skills-read-gate` reads — the two hooks must agree
on the marker directory, so keep them configured together. This is a per-Skill-invocation
hook (a fresh Python process per call, like every other `agents-hooks/v1` hook), so
`timeout_ms` is 800, not the more common 5000 — a marker-write must never noticeably delay a
Skill call on a slow filesystem, and this hook's whole job (one filesystem write) fits well
inside that budget.

**Session-dir growth is NOT garbage-collected here, on purpose.** Every session mints its
own `<session-id>/` subdirectory and nothing removes it, so the marker dir grows by one
subdirectory per session forever. An in-hook GC pass was prototyped and reverted — bounding
it safely (a per-pass time budget, a per-child scan bound, a retention floor that can't
undercut `SKILLS_FRESH_WINDOW_S`, all interacting under an 800ms timeout) turned out to need
its own focused PR. See the follow-up ticket linked from this hook's PR; an external
periodic sweep (cron/launchd), outside this hook's own timeout budget, is the leading
candidate over more in-hook GC.

**Fires on the attempt, not the outcome.** The point is `PreToolUse`, so the marker is
written when the skill is *invoked*, before CC resolves/runs it — there is no reliable
success/failure signal to gate on at this point in the tool lifecycle. In practice a typo'd
or nonexistent skill name still writes a marker, but under that WRONG name, so
`skills-read-gate`'s freshness check (keyed to the mandatory skill's own name) is unaffected.
The only way this over-certifies is the correct name being invoked and the underlying skill
itself failing to load — accepted, since this whole mechanism is advisory (WARN-first,
fail-open), not a security boundary.

## Never blocks

Every code path emits `allow`. A marker-write failure (permissions, a race, an odd
filesystem) is logged to stderr and otherwise ignored — recording a skill invocation is
advisory bookkeeping, not a gate, and it must never be able to stop a skill from running.

## Untrusted input handling

`args.skill` is model-controlled: the agent decides which skill to invoke, and a legitimate
directory-scoped skill name contains a `/` (e.g. `apps/web:deploy`). A `/`-containing name is
therefore allowed and nests under the marker dir (`mkdir -p` handles the subdirectory) — but
an absolute path, a `..` path segment, an embedded NUL, or an oversized value (>200 chars) is
rejected outright: nothing it writes may resolve outside `SKILLS_INVOKED_DIR`. The resolved
write target is checked against the resolved marker dir as a second, independent guard on top
of the name-level sanitization, in case a future caller skips that check.

`args.session_id` gets its own, stricter sanitization (`_sanitize_session_id`): it is always
treated as a SINGLE flat path segment, never split on `/` — a session id is CC-generated, not
model-controlled, so any `/`/`\` in it is a sign the value is not a real session id rather
than something to nest under. A session id that fails sanitization (or is absent) falls back
to the global, non-session-scoped marker path rather than being rejected outright — writer-
side spoofing here is low severity (worst case: a marker lands somewhere useless). The read
side (`skills-read-gate`) trusts the T2-hardened `session_id` to key its PRIMARY lookup, but
still also checks the global path as a lower-precedence fallback (see that hook's own README,
"The marker contract") — not because the write side can be spoofed into it, but because a
harness with no `pre-skill` producer of its own (Codex/opencode today) can only ever write
the global marker, and losing that would silently break its only workaround the moment ANY
session id happens to ride along on the event.

## Per-harness status

Claude Code: live once `rig` registers a `Skill` `PreToolUse` matcher for the bridge
(`riglib` `hook_bridge_entries`; the bridge half — the `pre-skill` point mapping in
`lib/cc_hook_bridge/dispatch.py` — ships in the same change as this hook). Codex/opencode:
not mapped yet — see `agent-hooks/README.md`'s `pre-skill` section for the current
per-harness table (the same gap the `pre-agent` point had before its bridges were wired).

## Fail-open, on purpose

`on_error: "open"`. A crash here must never wedge the ability to invoke a skill — worst
case, `skills-read-gate` simply doesn't see a fresh marker for that skill this session.
