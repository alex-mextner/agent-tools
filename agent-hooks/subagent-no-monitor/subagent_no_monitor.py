"""agents-hooks/v1 pre-monitor hook — stop a SUBAGENT from calling Monitor at all.

Sibling wedge to ``subagent-no-bg-longproc`` (agent-tools#52), hit in a different shape in
HYP-1350's retrospective (hyperide/hyper-saas PR #754): a dispatched subagent, instead of
backgrounding a Bash command, called the **Monitor** tool on its own spawned child process
and then ENDED ITS TURN expecting a completion notification. Monitor is CC's dedicated
fire-and-forget watch tool — start it, keep working, get notified per output line/event later
— which is precisely the shape that never reaches a subagent: a subagent is NOT re-invoked by
a Monitor-event notification, only the main loop is (Monitor has no "child" the harness
tracks against the calling agent). This is DIFFERENT from a Bash `run_in_background: true`
child, which the harness DOES track against its calling agent and DOES use to re-invoke that
agent once the child exits (verified empirically: a subagent that backgrounds a Bash job this
way and ends its turn is resumed with the job's output once it completes) — that is exactly
why remedy (1) below recommends it as Monitor's replacement for this one shape. So a subagent
that reaches for Monitor instead idles forever with uncommitted work and no PR, identical to
the Bash-backgrounding wedge `subagent-no-bg-longproc` blocks for a LABELED long process, just
via a tool that has no foreground mode and no harness-tracked child to fall back to at all.

Unlike ``subagent-no-bg-longproc``, there is no "foreground vs backgrounded" axis to classify
here: Monitor *is* the background primitive, unconditionally, by construction — there is no
such thing as a Monitor call that blocks the caller's turn until it finishes. So the rule is
simpler and unconditional: **any** subagent call to Monitor is the wedge. The orchestrator's
own Monitor use (e.g. watching a backgrounded subagent's own progress) is unaffected — this
gate governs only tool calls made INSIDE a dispatched subagent (``agent_id`` present).

The correct replacement depends on what the subagent is waiting for:

1. Waiting on a SINGLE long-running command it just started — set ``run_in_background: true``
   on the Bash tool call. The harness auto-resumes the subagent when that command completes; no
   Monitor is needed for this shape at all.
2. Waiting on anything else (a condition to become true, a file to appear, several things at
   once) — block on it SYNCHRONOUSLY in the foreground with a heartbeat loop: echo a line at
   least every ~20s and keep each Bash call comfortably under ~540s (well inside the Bash
   tool's own 600s hard cap), repeating the same bounded call until the wait is over, e.g.::

    timeout 540 bash -c 'i=0; until <condition-check> || [ "$i" -ge 26 ]; do sleep 20; i=$((i+1)); echo "[wait] tick $i ($((i*20))s)"; done'

Both shapes pass ``subagent-no-bg-longproc``'s own long-process/backgrounding rules (a
foreground heartbeat loop is not backgrounded; ``run_in_background: true`` is only blocked by
that sibling gate when the *backgrounded* command is itself a long-process label like
``review``/``--watch``/a build-test suite/a long ``sleep`` — an ordinary single command is
unaffected).

Contract (agents-hooks/v1):
  stdin  : JSON event; the subagent signal is in args.agent_id (or the top-level event)
  stdout : protocol JSON only       exit 0 : allow   exit 10 : BLOCK   other : error

on_error is "open": this is responsiveness/anti-wedge discipline, not a security boundary — a
crash here must never wedge a subagent's ability to call a tool.
