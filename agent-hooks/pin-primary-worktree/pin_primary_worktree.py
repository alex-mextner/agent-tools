"""agents-hooks/v1 pre-bash hook — pin the repo's PRIMARY worktree to its default branch.

Incident this closes (Alex tg#6462/tg#6477, 2026-07-04): an agent doing HYP-917 work ran
`git checkout feat/hyp-autofix-unsupported-framework` in the SHARED main checkout
(/Users/ultra/work/hyperide) instead of its own isolated worktree. No file damage happened
(the agent caught it immediately and had authored everything in its real worktree), but a
SECOND concurrent agent then also checked out (and committed on) a different feature branch
in that same shared checkout before switching back to main — a real collision waiting to
happen, since any agent relying on the primary checkout sitting on main can have the rug
pulled from under it mid-operation.

`worktree-only-writes` (the sibling pre-write gate) already denies an Edit/Write while the
checkout sits on the default branch — but it never sees a bare `git checkout <branch>` (not
an Edit/Write tool call), and once the checkout HAS moved to a feature branch, that gate's own
logic treats "on a feature branch" as "exactly where authoring belongs" — true for a linked
worktree, false for the primary one. Neither gate distinguishes "which worktree is this" from
"which branch is checked out", which is exactly the blind spot this incident exploited.

This hook closes that gap directly: it inspects `git checkout` / `git switch` invocations and
BLOCKS one that would move the PRIMARY worktree (never a `git worktree add`-created linked
worktree — see `is_primary_worktree`) onto anything other than the repo's default branch.
Checking OUT of a feature branch back to default, `git worktree add` (a different worktree
entirely), `git merge`/`git pull`/`git fetch`, and any checkout inside a LINKED worktree are
all unaffected. Complements (does not replace) `worktree-only-writes`.

PER-REPO, opt-in — reuses the SAME `agent_hooks.worktree_only` knob as `worktree-only-writes`
(one feature, one flag; see that hook's docstring for the resolution order: env
RIG_WORKTREE_ONLY > rig.yaml agent_hooks.worktree_only > default OFF).

External approval (replaces the OLD self-service escape hatch): there is NO env-var / inline
bypass for THIS checkout guard any more — an agent could set `RIG_ALLOW_MAIN_EDIT=1` on its own
command, so that "gate" was security theater (removed here per Alex tg#6554; the sibling
worktree-only-writes pre-write hook still reads that var — a separate cleanup). The block is
now DENY-BY-DEFAULT.
A repo owner may wire `agent_hooks.approval_cmd` (a shell command) in the committed,
code-reviewed rig.yaml; when a primary-worktree checkout is about to be blocked this hook runs
that command (with RIG_APPROVAL_* context in the child's env) and allows ONLY on exit 0.
Nothing configured = denied; a nonzero/error/timeout verdict = denied. An agent with a genuine
reason should ASK the human, not self-grant.

Contract (agents-hooks/v1):
  stdin  : JSON event; args.command/cmd (the bash string); event.cwd is the shell dir.
  stdout : protocol JSON only       exit 0 : allow   exit 10 : BLOCK   other : error

on_error is "open": workflow discipline, not a security boundary — any git/parse failure (or
an ambiguous target this hook cannot resolve, e.g. `git checkout -`'s previous-branch when
`@{-1}` itself fails to resolve) must never wedge the agent's ability to run a command.

Known, deliberate scope limits (heuristic, not a sandbox — see worktree-only-writes for the
same tradeoff): a `cd other-repo && git checkout X` chain is judged against the ORIGINAL cwd's
enrollment unless the segment itself carries `git -C <dir>` (which IS honored); `git reset`/
`git rebase` (branch-tip mutation without a HEAD-ref change) are out of scope for v1 — the
incident this closes was a `checkout`, and scope-creeping into every ref-mutating command
risks false positives for a first cut. A bare `git checkout .` / `git checkout <path>` restore
(no branch involved) is excluded via the `--`/`.` checks in `_switch_target`, but an unusual
`git checkout <treeish> <path>` (no `--`, ambiguous even to git itself) can still be
misclassified as a branch switch — a false block on that rare shape now needs a linked worktree
or a repo-owner `approval_cmd` (there is no self-service override any more; see the external
approval note above).

        immediately, NO subprocess. This is the default-DENY path: "nothing configured" means
        closed, never an automatic bypass.
      - CONFIGURED → run it. Exit 0 → approved (stdout, trimmed + capped, is the logged
        ``detail``). A nonzero exit, ANY subprocess exception, OR a timeout → NOT approved. An
        approval-cmd failure is ALWAYS resolved to deny HERE, inside this function — it never
        falls through to the hook's own ``on_error`` policy (that policy is for the hook's OWN
        plumbing failing, not for an approval verdict; a broken/hanging approval_cmd must mean
        "denied", regardless of whether this hook is on_error=open or on_error=closed).

    The child runs in its OWN process group (``start_new_session=True``) and, on timeout/error,
    the whole group is SIGKILLed (see ``_kill_process_group``) — so a well-meaning-but-broken

    never from the offending bash command being checked. The security rests on rig.yaml being a

    is outside this hook's threat model, exactly as for the sibling ``worktree_only`` knob that
    reads the same file. (This reads the working-tree copy and does NOT itself verify the file
    is committed/clean — that is left to code review, deliberately not re-implemented here; the
    distinction vs. the OLD hatch is that a bypass now requires a reviewed config change, not an
    env var / comment the agent invents per-command.) Dynamic data about WHAT is being approved
    (target, kind, cwd, the raw command) is passed to the child as ``RIG_APPROVAL_*`` environment

    `main()` keeps scanning LATER segments after an "approved" result — only a

    function replaces inline loop-body logic for: approving segment 1 must never skip
    evaluating a segment 2 in the same chained command.

    `deadline` is a `time.monotonic()` cutoff: if it has already passed by the time this
    segment would need an `approval_cmd` call, this returns `("block", ...)` WITHOUT spawning
    that subprocess (see `_MAIN_LOOP_BUDGET_S`'s module-level comment for why — a chained
    command with enough gate-worthy segments could otherwise push the AGGREGATE approval time
    past this hook's manifest timeout, and this hook's `on_error` is "open": an external kill
