"""agents-hooks/v1 pre-bash hook — require an AI review before a commit.

When the agent is about to `git commit`, this checks that an AI code review ran for
the current uncommitted state, by looking for a fresh marker file that the review
tool writes when it runs (and whose mtime is at least as new as the last change to
the index/working tree). If no review marker is found, it blocks with a reminder.

Wiring: have your review tool `touch` the marker on a successful run, e.g.
  review --uncommitted && touch "$REVIEW_MARKER"
The marker path is configurable via the REVIEW_MARKER env var; default below.

What is NOT gated (so the reminder stays honest and unobtrusive):
  - Anything that is not a real `git commit` SEGMENT — `git stash`, `git worktree`,
    `git status`, etc. (detection scopes to the parsed `git commit` argv, not the raw
    string, so a `commit` in a comment / message / pathspec never trips it).
  - A DOCS-ONLY commit — every staged path matches `*.md` or lives under a `docs/`
    directory. The project rule explicitly allows skipping review for docs.

External approval (replaces the OLD self-service escape hatch): there is NO env-var
(`REVIEW_SKIP`) or commit-message-trailer (`[skip-review: …]`) bypass any more — an agent
could set either on its own commit, so that "gate" was security theater. The block is now
DENY-BY-DEFAULT. A one-time exception is requested by setting
`RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_REQUIRE_REVIEW_BEFORE_COMMIT="<written justification>"`, which routes a
single approval request to the human via Telegram (deny-by-default; a bare `1`/`true` is
rejected — it needs a real justification). An agent with a genuine reason should ASK the
human, not self-grant.

Contract (agents-hooks/v1):
  stdin  : JSON event; the shell command is in args.command, the repo cwd in event.cwd
  stdout : protocol JSON only
  exit 0 : allow      exit 10 : BLOCK      other : error (host on_error policy)

on_error is "open": a crash here must never wedge the ability to commit — this is a
discipline reminder, not a security boundary. (Contrast block-no-verify, fail-closed.)

# logic is duplicated by design. NOTE: this copy tokenizes with `punctuation_chars=True` (see
# ``_tokenize``) so a GLUED separator (`foo;git commit`, `a&&git commit`) is split correctly — the
# sibling hooks use plain ``shlex.split``, which does NOT split glued separators and so under-splits
# such chains; they should adopt this tokenizer too. Keep the skip-flag / message handling in step.
# Every shell command separator `punctuation_chars=True` can emit as a standalone token, incl. the
