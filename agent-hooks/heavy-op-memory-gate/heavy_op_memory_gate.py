"""agents-hooks/v1 pre-bash hook — refuse to START a heavy operation while the
machine is genuinely under memory pressure.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-27/28 incident): a single long-running orchestrator session
had roughly 10-15 background agents running CONCURRENTLY, several doing heavy local
work at once — extension rebuilds (`build-and-install.sh`), multi-model `review`
passes (each spawning several `opencode run`/`codex exec` subprocess trees), full
test suites. Free memory on a 24GB machine dropped to ~65MB
(`vm_stat` showed ~4000 free pages at 16KB/page) and several real VS Code windows
hung on native "reload required" / "app not responding" modals. Nothing on the
machine was checking "is there room for one more heavy thing" before starting one.

THIS IS DELIBERATELY NOT A CONCURRENCY COUNTER OR A LOCK/SEMAPHORE. That shape was
considered and rejected: every existing pre-bash hook in this ecosystem decides
ALLOW/BLOCK FAST (this file included) — a hook that WAITS either blocks past the
dispatcher's timeout and then silently ALLOWS anyway (useless), or turns "machine
busy" into a hard failure with no visibility. A counting semaphore also needs a slot
released by whoever acquired it; an agent killed mid-operation (routine in this
ecosystem — session churn, `TaskStop`, a crash) leaks its slot forever, and reaping
a stale slot correctly is itself a hard, stateful problem — get it wrong and every
agent on the machine deadlocks on a phantom "queue" (see the "Double-block deadlock
configs" / "Never break depended-on tool" lessons this ecosystem has already paid
for). So this hook carries **zero persistent state** — no lock file, no counter, no
queue position. Every invocation re-reads the machine's REAL memory pressure at
that instant and decides fresh. Nothing to leak, nothing to go stale, nothing that
can deadlock a second hook.

The signal is macOS's own kernel jetsam pressure level
(`sysctl kern.memorystatus_vm_pressure_level`) — the exact value Activity Monitor's
"Memory Pressure" graph and the OS's own out-of-memory killer read, NOT a raw
"free pages" heuristic. Raw free-page counts are noisy on macOS (the OS deliberately
keeps free low by using spare RAM as disk cache — a healthy machine often shows a
few hundred MB "free" with plenty of headroom), so gating on a raw byte threshold
would false-positive constantly. The jetsam level collapses that noise into three
values: 1 = normal, 2 = warn, 4 = critical. This hook blocks at WARN-or-worse by
default (level >= 2) — deliberately proactive, since the goal is to stop the SECOND
heavy operation from tipping an already-strained machine into the incident above,
not to wait until the machine is already critical. Tune via
`RIG_HEAVY_OP_BLOCK_AT_LEVEL` (see below) if that default proves too aggressive in
practice. On any platform where this sysctl is unavailable (Linux, sandboxed
environments), the hook has no reliable signal and ALLOWS (fail-open) — see
`_read_linux_pressure_level` for the best-effort `/proc/pressure/memory` fallback
tried first.

"Heavy operation" is intentionally scoped to the operations actually implicated in
the incident: the extension rebuild script (`build-and-install.sh`),
`@vscode/vsce package`, the multi-model `review` CLI's heavy subcommands
(`diff`/`quorum`/`brainstorm`/`just-ask` — each spawns multiple provider
subprocess trees), and build/test-suite invocations (npm/pnpm/yarn/bun/deno/
cargo/go/make/rake/mvn/gradle/msbuild test|build|..., and the direct runners
playwright/cypress/jest/vitest/pytest).

Detection is TOKEN-based (`shlex.split`, exact token/adjacency matching), not a
raw substring search over the whole command string — deliberately NOT the
`enforce-timeout-on-bash` posture. That sibling hook's regex-over-raw-string
approach is safe there because it's advisory (warns and still allows); THIS hook
hard-blocks with no bypass, so the same approach would turn `git commit -m "make
all tests green"` or `task new --title "fix go build flake"` into a false-positive
hard block on a WARN-pressure machine (a real bug caught in review before this
hook shipped) — the quoted commit message becomes one shlex token ("make all
tests green"), not the bare word "make", so it never matches. The real siblings
that detect the SAME command classes (`no-long-inline-process`,
`subagent-no-bg-longproc`) are argv-aware for exactly this reason; this hook
doesn't port their full tokenizer (wrapper/env/job-boundary peeling) since it
doesn't need backgrounding semantics, just "don't match words trapped inside a
quoted argument" — plain `shlex.split` with exact-token comparison covers that.
An unparseable command (unbalanced quotes) falls back to whitespace-splitting,
which is still token-shaped (never a raw substring search).

No self-service bypass and deliberately NO Telegram hatch-escalation machinery
either (unlike most hard-block hooks in this ecosystem) — that machinery exists to
get a HUMAN JUDGMENT call on a decision only a human can make; whether the machine
currently has enough free memory is not a judgment call, it is an objective,
self-resolving fact that a plain retry re-measures. Wiring `tg-ctl` in here would
also reintroduce exactly the complexity/latency risk this hook was written to
avoid for a check that must stay fast and stateless. If pressure genuinely never
clears (every other agent is idle, nothing is going to free memory) that is itself
a signal worth telling the machine's operator about directly, not something to
hatch-approve past.

Contract (agents-hooks/v1):
  stdin  : JSON event; the shell command is in args.command
  stdout : protocol JSON only       exit 0 : allow   exit 10 : BLOCK   other : error

on_error is "open": a crash or an unreadable pressure signal here must never wedge
an agent's ability to run a command — this is an availability circuit-breaker, not
a security boundary.
