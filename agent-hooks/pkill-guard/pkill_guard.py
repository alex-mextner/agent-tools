"""agents-hooks/v1 pre-bash hook — block a PATTERN-based kill of a SHARED process name.

Denies a shell command that kills processes by NAME/PATTERN match (`pkill -f node`, `killall
codex`, `kill $(pgrep -f "review diff")`, `pgrep -f playwright | xargs kill`) when the pattern
being matched is a generic, widely-shared tool/process name — because `pkill -f`/`killall`/
`pgrep` match against EVERY process on the machine whose command line contains the pattern,
not just the caller's own. Two real incidents motivate this (2026-07-01 agent-ecosystem
retrospective, gap G-5): a subagent's `pkill -f "review diff"` killed a DIFFERENT session's
in-flight code review (2026-06-26), and a narrow-grep-based kill nearly killed another
session's e2e matrix run (2026-06-27). Both were accidental collateral damage, not deliberate
bypasses — this hook exists to turn "kill everything matching this word" into a deliberate,
scoped, or explicitly-approved action.

Detection is ARGV-BASED (shlex), not a raw substring match (same discipline as
block-raw-pr-merge / block-reset-hard / block-no-verify). Three shapes are covered:

  1. `pkill [flags] <pattern>` / `killall [flags] <name>...` — the pattern/name argument(s).
  2. `kill $(pgrep ...)` / `` kill `pgrep ...` `` / `kill $(pidof ...)` — a PID list sourced
     from a `pgrep`/`pidof` command substitution; the substitution's own pattern is extracted
     and classified.
  3. A pipeline that resolves PIDs by pattern and feeds them to `kill`: `pgrep <pattern> |
     xargs kill`, `pidof <name> | xargs kill`, or the "narrow grep" shape `ps aux | grep
     <pattern> | ... | xargs kill`.

A pattern is DANGEROUS (and requires approval) only when it is — or contains, as a whole
word/phrase — a known SHARED tool/process name (`_SHARED_PROCESS_NAMES` below) AND it carries
no session-scoping signal (`_looks_session_scoped`: a path, a hex/uuid-looking run, or a long
digit run — the shape of a worktree path, a harness user-data-dir prefix, a port, or a PID).
This is deliberately a DENYLIST of known-ambiguous names, not a blanket "block every pattern
kill" — the sanctioned e2e-harness recipe `pkill -9 -f "<user-data-dir-prefix>"` (repo
CLAUDE.md) and any `kill <pid>` must keep working with zero friction; only the actually
collateral-prone shape (a bare shared tool name with nothing scoping it to the caller's own
process) is gated.

Allowed (let through, no approval needed):
  - `kill <pid> [<pid> ...]` (optionally with a `-SIGNAL`/`-s SIGNAL` flag) — always
    PID-targeted, cannot hit another session's process by name collision.
  - A pattern carrying a session-scoping signal even if it also mentions a shared tool name
    (`pkill -f "/Users/ultra/work/hyperide-worktrees/agent-x/node_modules/.bin/vitest"`,
    `pkill -9 -f "hvsc-3-a1b2c3d4"`) — the match set is already narrow.
  - An unrecognized pattern not on the denylist — fails OPEN on unknowns so this hook never
    blocks a legitimate, project-specific kill it has no reason to distrust; it exists to gate
    KNOWN-ambiguous names, not to police every `pkill` invocation.
  - `dev stop` (the project's own safe, repo-scoped dev-process stop command) is never touched
    by this hook (it does not invoke pkill/killall/kill itself).

External approval (deny-by-default, no self-service bypass): request a one-time Telegram
approval by setting `RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_PKILL_GUARD="<written justification>"` — routes through
the shared `agenttools_hatch_escalation` helper (the same mechanism as background-subagent-gate
/ block-raw-pr-merge), auto-recorded in `overrides.log` (G-8). A blank/bare-flag value is
rejected. Nothing set = denied; use a PID-targeted `kill <pid>` or `dev stop` instead.

Known limitations (documented, not silently missed — same bar as sibling hooks: would a
confused, non-evasive agent produce this BY ACCIDENT?):
  - The denylist is necessarily incomplete; an unlisted shared name is not caught (fails open
    toward not blocking legitimate work — see "Allowed" above).
  - Only ONE level of command-substitution nesting is resolved for `kill $(...)`; a
    substitution containing a further nested substitution is not recursed into.
  - `pkill`/`killall` value-taking flags (`-u <user>`, `-g <pgrp>`, and similar) are NOT
    recognized as flags that consume the NEXT token — `_positionals` treats every non-flag
    token as a candidate pattern, so `pkill -u node` reads `node` (the `-u` filter's VALUE, a
    username, not a kill pattern) as if it were one and blocks it. This is an OVER-block
    (false positive), never a bypass — deliberately: this hook's `_positionals` docstring states
    the design outright ("treating a flag's operand as a candidate pattern too can only make the
    guard MORE conservative, never miss a real pattern"). Implementing pkill/killall's own
    getopt table (which differs between BSD/macOS and GNU/Linux `pkill`) to exclude a
    recognized flag's value specifically would trade this conservative-by-default posture for a
    parsing surface that could itself misclassify an unfamiliar flag shape; not done here.
  - Process filtering via `awk '/pattern/{print $2}'` (instead of `grep`/`pgrep`/`pidof`) piped
    into a kill is not recognized — only `pgrep`/`grep`/`egrep`/`fgrep`/`pidof` stages are
    scanned for a pattern.
  - A RELATIVE path (`pkill -f "node scripts/dev.js"`) is treated as session-scoping even
    though it is identical across every checkout of the same repo — only a bare, well-known
    GLOBAL bin directory (`/usr/bin/node`, `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3`) is excluded from the
    path signal; a shared relative path is not. Distinguishing "this path is unique to my
    session" from "this path merely contains a slash" in general would need knowledge of the
    caller's actual worktree root, which this hook does not have.
  - A shell alias for `pkill`/`kill`/`killall` is not resolved (same documented gap as every
    sibling hook in this catalog — aliases don't expand under a harness's `bash -c` anyway).
  - `_WRAPPER_VALUE_FLAGS` only recognizes a wrapper's SEPARATE-token value flags (`sudo -u
    alice`); a CLUSTERED short-flag form with a glued value (`sudo -ualice`, `sudo -up alice`
    meaning `-u -p alice`) is not unclustered the way `block-reset-hard`'s more heavily-hardened
    parser does, and can still misread the wrapped command in that specific shape. Only reachable
    with a wrapper flag an agent would rarely type glued/clustered by accident.
  - The session-scoping check (`_looks_session_scoped`) treats "a scoping-shaped token ANYWHERE
    in the pattern" as sufficient, which a DELIBERATELY crafted pattern can defeat: `pkill -f
    "node|session-a1b2c3d4"` — a regex alternation, since pkill's `-f` pattern is a POSIX
    extended regex — still matches every `node` process, but the scoping token elsewhere in the
    string reads as "scoped" to this heuristic. Same class of gap as a variable/nested-shell
    indirection (`TARGET=node pkill -f "$TARGET"`, `sh -c 'pkill -f node'`) — the ACTUAL pattern
    is only known after shell/variable expansion this hook cannot see. Both require deliberately
    crafted input, not an accidental shape (this hook's stated threat model, see the top of this
    docstring); not fixed here.
  - The "global bin dir" exclusion (`_GLOBAL_BIN_DIR_RE`) only recognizes a HANDFUL of
    well-known system prefixes (`/usr/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/bin`,
    `/sbin`); an equally machine-shared interpreter reached through a version manager
    (`/opt/homebrew/Cellar/node/24.1.0/bin/node`, `~/.nvm/versions/node/v22/bin/node`,
    `~/.pyenv/versions/3.12/bin/python`, an `asdf` shim) still reads as session-scoped just
    because it contains a `/`. Enumerating every version manager's path convention is an
    unbounded list not worth chasing here; the handful of bare system prefixes covers the
    cheap, common case.
  - A multi-line command containing a heredoc whose BODY happens to mention a denylisted name
    (`cat <<'EOF' > notes.md` followed by a body line like `pkill -f node`) is treated as if
    that body line were a real command (the newline-as-`;` tokenizer has no heredoc awareness,
    unlike the much more heavily-hardened `block-raw-pr-merge`) — an OVER-block (documenting a
    kill recipe gets blocked), never a bypass, but worth knowing before reaching for the
    Telegram hatch on a legitimately blocked doc edit.
  - Command substitution is only inspected in the narrow `kill $(...)` / `` kill `...` `` shape
    (shape 2 above) — a substitution appearing OUTSIDE a direct argument to `kill` (`echo
    $(pkill -f node)`, `x=$(pkill -f node)`) is not resolved at all. This hook's substitution
    handling exists specifically to unwrap the "PID list sourced from a pattern match" idiom,
    not to generically evaluate every substitution anywhere in the command.
  - An inverted-match filtering stage ahead of the real pattern (`grep -v <shared-name> | xargs
    kill`) reads `<shared-name>` as the pattern the same as a normal (non-`-v`) `grep` would,
    even though `-v` means the shared name is being EXCLUDED, not matched — an OVER-block (the
    pipeline is probably safe), never a bypass. `_patterns_for_stage` does not special-case `-v`;
    doing so would need to distinguish it from a `grep`/`pgrep` flag that merely happens to
    precede the pattern in some other position, which is not worth the added parsing surface for
    an over-block-only gap.

Contract (agents-hooks/v1):
  stdin  : JSON event; the shell command is in args.command (a few fallbacks below)
  stdout : protocol JSON only
  stderr : human logs
  exit 0 : allow      exit 10 : BLOCK      other : error (host on_error policy)

on_error is "closed": a parse failure or crash DENIES — a collateral pattern-kill slipping
through a broken guard is exactly the failure this hook exists to stop.

    A token that starts with a REAL, unquoted `#` is a comment; drop it and the rest of the
    chunk. Whether a `#` is "real" can NOT be decided from the POSIX-mode (quote-stripped)
    token alone: a quoted `'# heading'` dequotes to the same string a bare `# heading` would
    produce, so `tok.startswith("#")` on the dequoted token can't tell a genuine comment from a
    quoted argument that merely starts with `#`. Ported verbatim from `block-reset-hard`'s
    audited fix for the identical class of bug (originally found there as a `git reset --hard`
    bypass hidden behind a mid-line `#`). A second, quote-PRESERVING (`posix=False`)
    tokenization runs in parallel so the check lands on the RAW token (quotes/escapes intact):
    only a token that ITSELF starts with `#` in that raw form is a genuine, unquoted comment
    marker. Returns None on unbalanced quotes, or if the two passes disagree on token count
    (can't reliably align raw-to-dequoted; caller treats this as fail-closed) — this is also
    what closes the comment/quote-interaction bypass: a stray quote character sitting INSIDE a

    quote, merging the comment forward into a LATER line and swallowing a real `pkill` there
    into what looked like one giant quoted argument. The dual-pass raw/posix disagreement (or
    outright parse failure) on that merged text now falls through to the caller's fail-closed
    path instead of silently classifying the swallowed command as safe.

    A `#`-free line skips the raw pass entirely and returns the posix tokens directly — the raw
    pass exists SOLELY to disambiguate a genuinely unquoted `#`, so a line with no `#` at all
    gets an identical verdict from the posix pass alone. This is not just a constant-factor
    speedup: it also means a `#`-free line with an ordinary unquoted mid-word apostrophe or two
    (`echo it's; echo don't`) can never hit the raw/posix TOKEN-COUNT-disagreement branch below
    (posix mode opens a quote at a mid-word apostrophe and merges across it, non-posix mode
    doesn't — a difference that's real but irrelevant here since there's no `#` to disambiguate),
    which would otherwise force `_tokenize`'s multi-line merge-forward loop to retokenize a
    growing chunk from scratch on every subsequent line — quadratic in the number of remaining
