"""agents-hooks/v1 pre-bash hook — require mandatory skills before doing WORK.

Before a work-shaped action (a `git commit`, or a build/test command), this checks that the
mandatory/relevant skills were INVOKED this session. A skill encodes the rules the action
must follow (e.g. `delegate-work-to-subagents` before dispatching, `visual-proof-cycle`
before a UI "done"); doing the work without first reading the skill skips those rules.

How it knows a skill was invoked — the MARKER CONTRACT:
  A skill-invocation wrapper touches one file per invoked skill, nested under the CC session
  id that invoked it, in a marker dir:
      ~/.cache/agent-tools/skills-invoked/<session-id>/<skill-name>  (mtime = invocation time)
  A skill counts as invoked if its marker is FRESH (within SKILLS_FRESH_WINDOW_S, default
  7200s) and EITHER was written by THIS session, OR (lower precedence) the pre-session-
  scoping GLOBAL marker is fresh — see `_missing_skills`/`_marker_path`. The session-scoped
  check is what closes the leak: without it, one Claude Code session invoking a skill would
  silently satisfy every other concurrent session's gate too, and in practice CC's own
  writer never touches the global path anymore once a session id is available. The global
  fallback stays only for a harness with no session-aware writer of its own (Codex/opencode
  today) or a manual `touch`. The wrapper that touches it is the honest, satisfiable
  action — see the README. Configure the dir with SKILLS_INVOKED_DIR; the mandatory set with
  MANDATORY_SKILLS (comma-separated, default `delegate-work-to-subagents,visual-proof-cycle`).

TIERED (warn → block): if a mandatory skill has no fresh marker, the FIRST work action in
the window WARNs (allow + message); a REPEAT BLOCKs (tracked by a marker keyed by cwd, like
orchestrator-stays-thin). Default tier is WARN-FIRST so it never wedges while the
marker-writer is still being wired everywhere.

NOTE: a subagent doing work should still read its PROJECT skills, so this gate is NOT a blanket
subagent-exempt. BUT the two orchestration/visual defaults (delegate-work-to-subagents,
visual-proof-cycle) are STRUCTURALLY N/A for a dispatched subagent — the subagent IS the delegate
(re-delegation hangs), and a non-UI commit has no visual proof — so they are dropped from the
demanded set when agent_id is present (mirrors orchestrator-stays-thin's subagent detection).
Any project-specific MANDATORY_SKILLS entry still applies to subagents.

No self-service bypass. There is NO env var / inline sentinel an agent can set on its own
command to skip this gate — a self-grant is security theater. (Previously an
`ALLOW_SKIP_SKILLS=1` override was routinely forced onto EVERY subagent commit to dodge the
orchestration/visual defaults; that dominant false-block is now handled structurally — those
two defaults are dropped for a dispatched subagent, see above — so no blanket override is
needed.) For a genuine one-off, ASK the human, or request a ONE-TIME Telegram approval via
`RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_SKILLS_READ_GATE="<justification>"` (deny-by-default; a blank or bare `1` is
rejected — the value must be a real written justification). The request routes to the human
over Telegram (tg-ctl) and allows ONLY on their approval.

Contract (agents-hooks/v1):
  stdin  : JSON event; the shell command is in args.command
  stdout : protocol JSON only       exit 0 : allow   exit 10 : BLOCK   other : error

on_error is "open": process discipline, not a security boundary — a crash must never wedge
the ability to commit/build.

# Orchestration/visual defaults dropped from a dispatched subagent's demanded set (agent_id
# present); any OTHER (project-specific) mandatory skill still applies. Rationale + an accepted
# tradeoff:
#   - delegate-work-to-subagents — the subagent IS the delegated work; demanding it delegate again
#     is wrong (a sub-subagent dispatch hangs). Unconditionally N/A for a subagent.
#   - visual-proof-cycle — this gate fires on the command SHAPE (commit/build/test), not the
#     commit's content, so it cannot tell a subagent's UI commit from a non-UI one. We drop the
#     default for ALL subagent commits, which means a subagent doing REAL UI work also bypasses the
#     visual-proof reminder. That is the accepted cost of fixing the dominant false-block (issue
#     #112): the prior state forced an ALLOW_SKIP_SKILLS override on EVERY subagent commit. A
#     project that wants visual proof enforced on subagents can add a project-specific UI skill to
#     MANDATORY_SKILLS (those are NOT dropped). The orchestrator (no agent_id) still gets both.
#
# OPEN QUESTION, documented rather than silently assumed: whether a dispatched subagent's CC
# events carry the SAME top-level session_id as its parent orchestrator's, or a distinct one, is
# not settled by anything in this repo (no existing fixture sets both agent_id and session_id
# together). If it is the SAME id, session-scoping (see `_marker_path`) is transparent here —
# orchestrator and subagent share markers within one conversation, as before. If it is DISTINCT,
# a subagent's own project-specific mandatory skill (the ones NOT in SUBAGENT_NA_SKILLS) would
# need its own fresh marker written from inside that subagent's session — a subagent that relies
# on the orchestrator having invoked it would now see it as missing.
#
# CORRECTION vs. an earlier version of this comment: the worst case is NOT "an extra advisory
# WARN, never a hard block" — the WARN/BLOCK escalation TIER is ALSO session-scoped (see
# `_tier_marker`), so a subagent that repeats a work action within its OWN session while
# genuinely missing a project-specific skill escalates to a real BLOCK on the second action,
# same as any other session would. This is arguably the CORRECT behavior, not a bug: if the
# subagent's session truly never invoked the skill, it plausibly never had that skill's rules
# loaded either, so demanding it invoke its own copy is consistent with what the gate is FOR —
# but it is a real behavior change from the pre-session-scoping global-marker world (where the
# parent's invocation transparently satisfied the subagent via the shared global marker), not
# the harmless "extra WARN" this comment previously claimed. Same mitigation as any other false
# positive: `RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_SKILLS_READ_GATE` (see `_block_message`) is the escape valve, not
# a code-level exemption for the DISTINCT-session-id case.
