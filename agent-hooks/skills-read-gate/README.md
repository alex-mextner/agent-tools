# skills-read-gate

**Point:** `pre-bash` · **Fail policy:** `open` · **Priority:** 48

Before a **work-shaped action** — a `git commit`, or a build/test command — this checks that
the **mandatory skills were invoked** this session. A skill encodes the rules the action must
follow (e.g. `delegate-work-to-subagents` before dispatching, `visual-proof-cycle` before a
UI "done"); doing the work without reading the skill skips those rules.

## The marker contract (how it knows a skill was invoked)

A skill-invocation wrapper **touches one file per invoked skill** in a marker dir:

```
~/.cache/agent-tools/skills-invoked/<skill-name>     # mtime = invocation time
```

A skill counts as invoked if its marker is **fresh** (within `SKILLS_FRESH_WINDOW_S`,
default `7200`s). Wire the wrapper to touch it on every Skill-tool invocation:

```bash
mkdir -p "${SKILLS_INVOKED_DIR:-$HOME/.cache/agent-tools/skills-invoked}"
touch "${SKILLS_INVOKED_DIR:-$HOME/.cache/agent-tools/skills-invoked}/<skill-name>"
```

This is the honest, satisfiable action: invoking the skill writes its marker, which is what
the gate checks — it is real wiring, not a forge.

Configure via env:

- `SKILLS_INVOKED_DIR` — marker dir (default `~/.cache/agent-tools/skills-invoked`)
- `MANDATORY_SKILLS` — comma list (default `delegate-work-to-subagents,visual-proof-cycle`)
- `SKILLS_FRESH_WINDOW_S` — freshness window in seconds (default `7200`)
- `SKILLS_TIER_DIR` — warn/block tier marker dir (default `~/.cache/agent-tools/skills-read-tier`)

> The env-configured marker dirs are read at import time; CC re-invokes the script per call, so
> each call picks up the current env — this is fine, not a footgun.

## Tiering — WARN then BLOCK

If a mandatory skill has no fresh marker, the **first** work action WARNs (allow + message);
a **repeat** in the window BLOCKs (tracked by a cwd-keyed marker). The default WARN-first tier
means the gate never wedges while the marker-writer is still being wired everywhere.

## Subagents: exempt from the orchestration/visual defaults, still gated on project skills

A subagent doing work should still have read its **project** skills, so this gate is **not** a
blanket subagent-exempt (unlike the orchestration gates 1–3). But the two default-mandatory
skills are **structurally N/A for a dispatched subagent** and are dropped from its demanded set:

- `delegate-work-to-subagents` — the subagent **is** the delegated work; demanding it delegate
  again is wrong (a sub-subagent dispatch hangs).
- `visual-proof-cycle` — a subagent committing a non-UI file has no visual proof to give.

A subagent is detected by an **`args.agent_id`** forwarded into the v1 event by
`lib/cc_hook_bridge` (present only inside a dispatched subagent; the bridge fills it from CC's
authoritative field and drops any model-supplied copy). Any **other** skill named in
`MANDATORY_SKILLS` (a project-specific rule) still applies to a subagent; only the two
orchestration/visual defaults are dropped. The orchestrator (no `agent_id`) gets the full gate.

> **Trust surface:** because this gate uses `agent_id` to *relax*, it reads ONLY the sanitized
> `args.agent_id` — not a top-level `event.agent_id` (which the bridge never writes and would be a
> trusted-but-unsanitized self-exempt vector). This is a deliberate narrowing vs.
> `orchestrator-stays-thin`, which still reads the top-level fallback.

> **Footgun:** the two names in `SUBAGENT_NA_SKILLS` (`delegate-work-to-subagents`,
> `visual-proof-cycle`) are dropped for subagents **by name, regardless of source** — so listing
> one of them EXPLICITLY in `MANDATORY_SKILLS` does NOT re-enable it for subagents (they are N/A
> for a subagent by their nature, not by config). If you want a subagent gated on visual proof,
> add a **differently-named** project skill to `MANDATORY_SKILLS` — that one is not dropped.

## No self-service bypass — request a Telegram approval instead

There is **no** env var or inline sentinel an agent can set on its own command to skip this
gate (a self-grant is security theater). The dominant reason one used to be forced —
`ALLOW_SKIP_SKILLS=1` on every subagent commit to dodge the orchestration/visual defaults — is
now handled **structurally** (those two defaults are dropped for a dispatched subagent, see
above), so no blanket override is needed. For a genuine one-off, **ASK the human**, or request
a **one-time Telegram approval**:

```bash
RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_SKILLS_READ_GATE="docs-only commit, the mandatory skills are N/A here" npm test
```

The request routes to the human over Telegram (`tg-ctl ask`) and the action is allowed **only**
on their approval. It is **deny-by-default**: a blank value or a bare `1`/`true` (no real
justification) is rejected without sending the message, and any nonzero/timeout/error verdict
denies. This replaces the old `ALLOW_SKIP_SKILLS` / `# skills-ok:` self-service hatch (removed).

## Fail-open, on purpose

`on_error: "open"`. Process discipline, not a security boundary — a crash must never wedge
the ability to commit/build.

## Test

Capture the hook's exit on its OWN line right after the pipe (so it's the hook's exit, not
`echo`'s):

```bash
chmod +x skills_read_gate.py
# no fresh markers → first commit WARNs, the next BLOCKs
echo '{"cwd":"/r","args":{"command":"git commit -m x"}}' | ./skills_read_gate.py
rc=$?; echo "exit=$rc"   # → exit=0 (first offense, WARN)
echo '{"cwd":"/r","args":{"command":"git commit -m x"}}' | ./skills_read_gate.py
rc=$?; echo "exit=$rc"   # → exit=10 (repeat → BLOCK)

# touch every mandatory skill's marker → allow
mkdir -p ~/.cache/agent-tools/skills-invoked
touch ~/.cache/agent-tools/skills-invoked/delegate-work-to-subagents ~/.cache/agent-tools/skills-invoked/visual-proof-cycle
echo '{"cwd":"/r","args":{"command":"git commit -m x"}}' | ./skills_read_gate.py
rc=$?; echo "exit=$rc"   # → exit=0 (markers fresh → allow)
```
