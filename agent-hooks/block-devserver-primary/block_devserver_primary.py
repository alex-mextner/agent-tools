"""agents-hooks/v1 pre-bash hook — block launching a dev server / build watcher against the
checkout sitting on the repo's DEFAULT branch, on an ENROLLED repo.

Incident this closes (2026-08-28, hyperide session internal task #191, agent-tools#454): agents
doing a quick "live verification" pass — start a dev server, check a fix renders — kept doing it
directly against the SHARED checkout instead of a disposable worktree. In hyperide this is not
hypothetical: the canvas preview generator (`lib/preview-generator`) OVERWRITES `client/App.tsx`
and the git-TRACKED `client/__canvas_preview__.tsx` (see hyperide's own `.gitignore` comment: it is
"deliberately TRACKED... hyperide self-hosts inside HyperIDE") as a SIDE EFFECT of the dev server
running — no `git` command, no `Edit`/`Write` tool call, nothing the sibling hooks below can see.
One such pass corrupted both files with 2000+ generated lines, requiring a dedicated cleanup pass.

This hook is the Bash-launch counterpart to the two existing worktree-only-workflow hooks:
  - `worktree-only-writes` (pre-write) blocks an Edit/Write while on the default branch, but a
    dev server's own writes are not Edit/Write tool calls — invisible to it.
  - `pin-primary-worktree` (pre-bash) blocks a `git checkout`/`switch` off the default branch, but
    `npm run dev` is not a `git` command — invisible to it.
  - Claude Code's OWN built-in worktree-isolation Bash guard (a separate, upstream feature) only
    inspects commands that reach into the checkout via `cd`/`-C` AND run `git` — verified live: a
    plain `cd <shared-checkout> && npm run dev` (zero git) sails through it untouched.
None of the three sees "a dev server about to run against the checkout that must stay on main."
This hook closes exactly that gap: it recognizes common dev-server / dev-watch launch commands
(`npm run dev`, `vite`, `next dev`, ...) and BLOCKS them when the effective working directory (the
event `cwd`, adjusted for a literal leading `cd <dir> &&` prefix in the SAME command) sits on the
enrolled repo's default branch — the same condition `worktree-only-writes` already uses for
Edit/Write, applied to the one Bash shape that bypasses it.

Deliberately NOT covered: generic file redirection (`>`, `tee`), `sed -i`/`perl -i`, or `rm` run
directly in Bash targeting a tracked source file — the sibling `no-shell-file-edit` hook (also
`pre-bash`, unconditional, NOT tied to `worktree_only` enrollment) already hard-blocks exactly
that class repo-wide, everywhere, on every branch — see its own README for the full parsed-not-
raw-matched command coverage (`sed -i`, `perl -i`, `gawk -i inplace`, `> file`/`>> file`/`tee`/
`dd of=`, wrapped in `bash -c`/`sh -c`, VAR= prefixes peeled). A worktree-scoped reimplementation
here would be redundant with it, not a gap. `git commit` directly in the primary checkout is
likewise handled by DESIGN elsewhere in the layering, not left open: `require-review-before-
commit`/`require-ticket-before-commit` gate every commit regardless of location, and even a
committed-but-unpushed change on the primary checkout's main is caught at push time by the
pre-push `protect-main` git-hook (agent-tools#157) — `worktree-only-writes`'s own docstring
documents this split (pre-write blocks the AUTHORING, pre-push blocks the PUSH) — so adding a
`git commit`-specific check here would duplicate an existing, deliberate gate rather than close
a real one. What remained genuinely uncovered — confirmed by testing this repo's own machine,
not assumed — was a dev-server LAUNCH: no existing hook (this repo's own or Claude Code's
built-in worktree-isolation Bash guard, which is git-command-focused) recognizes `npm run dev`/
`vite`/etc. at all, on any branch, in any checkout. That is the one gap this hook exists to
close, with a narrow, low-false-positive signature (a fixed handful of well-known
package-manager scripts and CLI binaries) rather than a general "any Bash mutation" detector.

PER-REPO, opt-in: reuses the EXACT SAME `agent_hooks.worktree_only` knob as `worktree-only-writes`
and `pin-primary-worktree` (env `RIG_WORKTREE_ONLY` > rig.yaml `agent_hooks.worktree_only` >
default OFF) — one feature, one flag, three enforcement points.

External approval: same deny-by-default hatch pattern as the sibling hooks. No self-service
env-var bypass. `RIG_HATCH_REQUEST_BLOCK_DEVSERVER_PRIMARY="<justification>"` asks the human via
Telegram once; approved → allow, otherwise (or unset) → block.

Contract (agents-hooks/v1):
  stdin  : JSON event; args.command/cmd (the bash string); event.cwd is the shell dir.
  stdout : protocol JSON only       exit 0 : allow   exit 10 : BLOCK   other : error

on_error is "open": workflow discipline, not a security boundary — a git/parse failure must never
wedge the agent's ability to run a command.

    """Split on shell operators (&&, ||, ;, |, newline, a bare control &) that lie OUTSIDE quotes.

    Returns ``(preceding_operator, segment_text)`` pairs — the operator that separates this
    segment from the one before it (``None`` for the very first segment). `main()` uses this
    two ways: (1) to tell an UNCONDITIONALLY-reached `cd` (the first segment, or one following
    `;`/newline/`&`, which always runs regardless of any prior command's exit code) from a
    CONDITIONALLY-reached one (following `&&`/`||`, whose execution depends on an exit code this
    hook has no way to evaluate — see `main()`'s docstring note for how it handles this
    uncertainty); (2) alongside the FOLLOWING segment's own preceding-operator, to tell a `cd`
    that runs in an isolated subshell (piped into/out of via `|`, or backgrounded via `&`, either
    of which discards its directory change once that subshell exits) from one that actually
    affects the parent shell's cwd.

    A double-quoted region honors a backslash-escaped quote (``\\"``) as a literal character, not
    the end of the string — an odd number of trailing backslashes immediately before a `"` escapes
    it (Codex review, PR agent-tools#469). Without this, ``printf '%s' "a\\"b" && npm run dev``
    closes the quoted region one character early ('a\\"' reads as a complete, escaped-quote-naive
    string), leaving the trailing ``b" && npm run dev`` parsed as UNQUOTED text — the `&&` inside
    it is then treated as a real chain-operator split point mid-string, silently misplacing where
    the `npm run dev` member actually starts. The same escape-awareness also applies when
    OPENING a quote from outside any quoted region: `echo \\" && npm run dev`'s `\\"` is a literal
    escaped quote in a real shell, not a region opener — unconditionally opening one there (an
    earlier version of this function did) swallows the real `&&` that follows into the
    "unterminated string", hiding the `npm run dev` member from ever being split out at all.
    Single quotes need no closing-escape handling — POSIX single quotes are fully literal,
    backslash has no special meaning inside them, so the existing generic "close on matching
    quote char" branch is already correct for closing one; OPENING one is still escape-checked
    (`\\'` outside quotes is equally a literal character, not a region opener)."""

    against wherever it already was.

    The disk-existence check is load-bearing, not cosmetic: a naive version that always
    "succeeds" here is a real bypass. `cd /does-not-exist; npm run dev` (or `... || npm run
    dev`) in a REAL shell leaves the shell in its ORIGINAL directory when `cd` fails — but a
    version of this function that unconditionally returned the (nonexistent) target would move
    `effective_cwd` there, and the following `npm run dev` would then be judged against a
    directory with no git repo at all → `_resolve_gate` fails open → ALLOW, even though the real
    dev server is about to start in the still-protected original checkout. Checking `is_dir()`
    closes this: an unresolvable target is treated the same as a bare `cd`/`cd -` — untracked,
    so the caller keeps evaluating against the REAL (unchanged) cwd, which is the safe direction
    even in the false-positive case (a `mkdir -p new && cd new && ...` where `new` doesn't exist
    at hook-eval time yet — this hook has no shell to run the `mkdir` first, so `new` looks
    nonexistent and a later segment is judged against the stale cwd instead; over-blocking, not
    under-blocking).

    A bare `cd` (→ $HOME) or `cd -` (→ `$OLDPWD`, a value this hook never sees) are likewise

    (`_PM_SKIP_VALUE_FLAGS`, skipped with no override), or any other single valueless-looking
    flag token — stopping at the first REAL non-flag token (the `run`/script-name itself) or a
    literal `--` (npm's own "everything after this is forwarded verbatim to the script, not
    npm's own option" separator). This is npm/yarn/pnpm's own GLOBAL-OPTIONS region, which comes
    BEFORE `run`/the script name in real usage (`npm --prefix <dir> run dev`, `pnpm -C <dir>
    dev`, `pnpm --filter web dev`).

    Scanning the WHOLE array (a prior version of this function did) is a real bypass, not just
    imprecise: `npm run dev -- --prefix /feature-worktree` forwards `--prefix /feature-worktree`
    to the `dev` SCRIPT as an argument — npm's own cwd is untouched, the dev server still starts
    in the invoking checkout — but a whole-array scan reads that forwarded flag as npm's own
    `--prefix`, computes a `cwd_override` pointing at the harmless feature worktree, and the
    gate wrongly judges (and allows) a launch that actually runs in the protected checkout.
    Restricting the scan to the LEADING run, stopping at `--`, closes this: a flag appearing
    after `run <script>`/`--` is never treated as npm's own option.

    The `=`-joined form is ALSO a real bypass, not just imprecision, if unhandled: from a
    harmless feature worktree, `npm --prefix=/path/to/shared-main run dev` really does make npm
    operate against the shared checkout — but the split-form-only version of this function
    couldn't recognize `--prefix=/path/to/shared-main` as `_DIR_FLAGS`, left `cwd_override`
    unset, and the gate fell back to `effective_cwd` (the harmless feature worktree) — wrongly
    ALLOWING a launch that actually targets the protected checkout.

    `_PM_SKIP_VALUE_FLAGS` exists because a NAIVE "skip one token per flag" (the fallback below,
    for any OTHER unrecognized flag) breaks on a value-taking flag whose value doesn't itself
    start with `-`: `pnpm --filter web dev` would otherwise stop at `web` (not `-`-prefixed) and
    misread it as the script-name position, missing `dev` entirely — an under-block (safe: a
    MISS, not a wrong-cwd allow), not a bypass. This is not a general CLI parser: an UNKNOWN
    SPLIT-form value-taking flag (anything outside `_DIR_FLAGS`/`_PM_SKIP_VALUE_FLAGS`, e.g.
    `npm --userconfig /tmp/npmrc run dev`) still has this exact miss — see the README's scope
    limits; the `=`-joined form of an unknown flag is self-contained in one token and does NOT
    have this problem regardless of whether the flag is recognized."""

      resolved target: the `cd` did run). A single always-safe direction (e.g. "assume it never
      ran") is NOT sound here: `false && cd /feature; npm run dev` from a protected checkout
      needs "didn't run" to correctly BLOCK (the launch stays in the protected checkout), but
      `true && cd /protected-main; npm run dev` from a feature worktree needs "did run" to
      correctly BLOCK (the launch reaches the protected checkout) — the same fixed assumption
      gets one of the two wrong. Tracking both keeps both correct."""
