"""agents-hooks/v1 pre-bash hook — block `git reset --hard` and `git clean -f...`.

Denies a shell command that irreversibly wipes uncommitted/untracked work with zero undo:

  - `git reset --hard` (with or without a ref) — discards uncommitted TRACKED changes.
  - `git clean` with a real `-f`/`--force` flag (alone or clustered with `-d`/`-x`, in any
    short-flag order) — discards untracked files.

Both are the same failure class: a destructive rewrite of the working tree that git cannot
undo afterward (unlike `git reset` without `--hard`, which never touches the working tree,
or `git clean -n`, which only previews). This hook exists because an incident showed nothing
technically stops an agent from running either mid-session: a subagent working an unrelated
PR ran `git reset --hard` in a checkout shared with a different session and wiped that
session's uncommitted work. The incident was ACCIDENTAL, not a deliberate bypass — this
hook's real value is turning an accidental destructive reset/clean into a DELIBERATE,
LOGGED one. It previously shipped a self-service escape hatch (an env var / inline comment the
agent could set on its own command); that was security theater and was removed (Alex tg#6554).
The block is now DENY-BY-DEFAULT with the external approval_cmd extension point below.

Detection is ARGV-BASED, not a raw substring match (same discipline as block-raw-pr-merge /
block-no-verify / require-ticket-before-commit). The command is tokenized LINE BY LINE (a
newline is a command separator, same as `;` — a two-line Bash call is a common, entirely
accidental shape: `cd /repo` then `git reset --hard` on the next line is the literal incident
this hook guards against) with a word-boundary-aware `#` comment scan (a `#` mid-word, e.g.
`foo#bar`, is literal text to a real shell, NOT a comment — shlex's default commenter gets
this wrong and would truncate parsing there, silently hiding a later chained command; ported
fix from block-no-verify/require-review-before-commit), then split into shell segments (`;` /
`&&` / `||` / `|` separated). Each segment's real argv is recovered by stripping leading
shell-grouping/control-flow tokens (`(`, `{`, `if`, `while`, `case`, ...), inline `VAR=value`
env assignments, a set of common wrapper executables (`timeout`, `sudo`, `env`, `nice`,
`time`, `exec`, `command`, `setsid`, `nohup`, ... — ported from block-no-verify /
require-ticket-before-commit's wrapper table, since a destructive command hidden behind
`sudo -u user git reset --hard` or `time git clean -fd` is exactly the bypass shape those
sibling hooks already fought), and git's own global options (`-C`, `-c`, `--git-dir`, ...) so
the git subcommand is exposed even behind `git -C <dir> reset --hard`. This prevents a false
positive where a commit message, code comment, doc, or `grep` merely MENTIONS the phrase
"reset --hard" or "clean -fd" as text.

Allowed (let through — the safe alternatives this hook steers agents toward):
  - `git checkout -- <file>` / `git restore <file>` (discard specific tracked files, scoped)
  - `git reset` with no `--hard` (bare, `--mixed`, `--soft`) — never touches the working tree
  - `git clean -n` / `git clean --dry-run` (preview only)
  - `git clean` with no force flag at all (git itself refuses to delete without `-f`)
  - text that merely mentions "reset --hard" or "clean -fd" (commit message, comment, grep)

External approval (replaces the OLD self-service escape hatch): there is NO env-var
(ALLOW_GIT_RESET_HARD) and NO inline `# no-reset-guard:` bypass any more — an agent could set
either on its own command, so that "gate" was security theater (removed per Alex tg#6554).
The block is now DENY-BY-DEFAULT. A repo owner may wire `agent_hooks.approval_cmd` (a shell
command) in the committed, code-reviewed rig.yaml; when a reset --hard / clean -f is about to
be blocked this hook runs that command (with RIG_APPROVAL_* context in the child's env) and
allows ONLY on exit 0. Nothing configured = denied; a nonzero/error/timeout verdict = denied.
An agent with a genuine reason should ASK the human, not self-grant.

Known limitations — there is no longer a self-service hatch (removed — Alex tg#6554), so the
parser is the only line; the bar for what's fixed above vs. documented below remains: would a
confused, non-evasive agent produce this exact command BY ACCIDENT? Newline-separated commands
and mid-word `#` (fixed above) clear that bar; these don't:
  - `git reset --har` (an unambiguous long-option prefix git itself accepts) is not detected;
    only the literal `--hard` spelling is matched — no one accidentally abbreviates a
    destructive flag they're not trying to type in full.
  - `git clean -e -f` (a bare `-e` immediately followed by a SEPARATE `-f`-shaped token) is
    conservatively treated as a real `-f` (blocked) by this hook, even though real git parses
    that trailing token as `-e`'s exclude-pattern VALUE (confirmed empirically: `git clean -e
    -f` prints "clean.requireForce is true and -f not given: refusing to clean" — i.e. real
    git does NOT treat it as force). This is a FALSE BLOCK, not a bypass — the safe-by-default
    direction for a destructive-action guard, and not worth getopt-style value tracking for
    such an exotic input shape.
  - `git -c clean.requireForce=false clean -d` (or the same set as an AMBIENT gitconfig, not
    inline) makes a bare `clean -d` — no `-f` at all — actually delete, contradicting this
    hook's "no force flag = git refuses" assumption. Not detected: nobody sets this inline by
    accident, but if it's ALREADY in someone's ambient config, a bare `clean -d` silently
    slips past this hook for real. Worth knowing, not worth building a git-config-value
    detector for.
  - A shell alias for `git` (`alias g=git`) is not resolved — universal to this whole hook
    family (aliases only expand in an INTERACTIVE shell by default; a harness running via
    `bash -c "<command>"` doesn't expand them anyway, so this is rarely reachable in practice).
  - `env -S/--split-string '<command>'` (a re-tokenized inline command string), a nested
    shell-string interpreter (`bash -c 'git reset --hard'`), a command substitution
    (`$(git reset --hard)`), or a wrapper outside a brace group are not re-parsed — same
    documented gap as block-no-verify; all require deliberately crafted input, not an
    accidental shape.
  - An unlisted/exotic wrapper (`unshare`, `nsenter`, `firejail`, ...) is not peeled.

Contract (agents-hooks/v1):
  stdin  : JSON event; the shell command is in args.command (a few fallbacks below)
  stdout : protocol JSON only
  stderr : human logs
  exit 0 : allow      exit 10 : BLOCK      other : error (host on_error policy)

on_error is "closed": a parse failure or crash DENIES — a destructive reset/clean slipping
through a broken guard is exactly the failure this hook exists to stop.

      - approval_cmd UNCONFIGURED in the repo's committed rig.yaml → ``(False, None)``
        immediately, NO subprocess. This is the default-DENY path: "nothing configured" means
        closed, never an automatic bypass.
      - CONFIGURED → run it. Exit 0 → approved (stdout, trimmed + capped, is the logged
        ``detail``). A nonzero exit, ANY subprocess exception, OR a timeout → NOT approved. An
        approval-cmd failure is ALWAYS resolved to deny HERE, inside this function — it never
        falls through to the hook's own ``on_error`` policy (that policy is for the hook's OWN
        plumbing failing, not for an approval verdict; a broken/hanging approval_cmd must mean
        "denied", regardless of whether this hook is on_error=open or on_error=closed).

    The child runs in its OWN process group (``start_new_session=True``) and, on timeout/error,
    the whole group is SIGKILLed (see ``_kill_process_group``) — so a well-meaning-but-broken
    approval_cmd that backgrounds a child holding the stdout pipe can't hang the hook past its
    internal timeout and thereby reach the dispatcher's fail-open.

    TRUST BOUNDARY (why ``shell=True`` is deliberate and safe here): the command STRING comes
    ONLY from ``agent_hooks.approval_cmd`` in rig.yaml — never from the agent's live command,
    never from the offending bash command being checked. The security rests on rig.yaml being a
    REVIEWED config that changes go through: an agent that can already edit-and-commit rig.yaml
    is outside this hook's threat model, exactly as for the sibling ``worktree_only`` knob that
    reads the same file. (This reads the working-tree copy and does NOT itself verify the file
    is committed/clean — that is left to code review, deliberately not re-implemented here; the
    distinction vs. the OLD hatch is that a bypass now requires a reviewed config change, not an
    env var / comment the agent invents per-command.) Dynamic data about WHAT is being approved
    (target, kind, cwd, the raw command) is passed to the child as ``RIG_APPROVAL_*`` environment
    variables ONLY, never string-interpolated into the command, so there is no injection surface
    from agent-controlled data.
