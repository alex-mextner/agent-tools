"""agents-hooks/v1 stop hook — inject the completion self-check.

Fires when the agent is about to END its turn. It BLOCKS the stop exactly once,
returning a self-check prompt as the block message so the agent must run the check
before it can finish. A per-turn marker (keyed by the event's session id) prevents an
infinite stop→block→stop loop: the second time it sees the same session it allows the
stop.

This turns the `task-completion-selfcheck` ritual from advisory text into an enforced
prompt — the model is reliably nudged to (1) confirm everything was done and (2)
surface concrete follow-ups, instead of stopping at the first thing that worked.

Which prompt variant fires is picked from the turn's own transcript (best-effort — see
_classify_turn), not a single static string for every turn:

  - HEDGE   : the agent's own reply offered to do something ("I can check...", or its
              Russian equivalent "могу поискать" / "I can search") instead of doing it,
              and never actually used a tool this turn. A generic "did I finish
              everything" checklist doesn't catch this —
              it's not a missed step, it's a DEFERRED one. Quote the offer back and say
              "no, do it now."
  - LIGHT   : a pure text reply with no tool calls at all, and no hedge detected. The
              full engineering checklist (commits/push/deploy/cleanup) is noise here —
              asking it anyway teaches shallow "yep all done" pattern-completion that
              then carries over to turns where it matters. Ask one relevant question
              instead.
  - FULL    : the original checklist, for turns where real work happened (tool calls
              occurred) — unchanged from before this file learned to read transcripts.

Any transcript read/parse failure (missing path, bad JSON, unexpected shape) falls back
to FULL — this is a heuristic enhancement layered on a hook whose top-level contract is
fail-open; a parsing bug must never produce a worse or blocking-different outcome than
before, only silently lose the extra precision.

Cooldown (agent-tools#529): the marker used to be *deleted* the moment a stop was
allowed ("consumed so a later genuinely-new task re-prompts"). Scanning real session
transcripts (2026-09) showed the actual effect in a long-lived autonomous/watch-loop
session: every wake-up (ScheduleWakeup, a background-agent poll, ...) ends its own turn
with a Stop, so deleting the marker on the very next allowed stop meant the NEXT wake —
sometimes under a minute later — was treated as a brand-new session and re-blocked, over
and over, all day. Measured inter-firing gaps in real logs were as low as 5-70s (median
under 5 minutes in the busiest sessions), nowhere near the intended 30-minute TTL. The
fix is to stop deleting the marker on allow: a block now stays in effect for the full TTL
window, so at most one block fires per TTL rather than one per Stop event. A session that
starts a genuinely new task before the TTL expires simply doesn't get re-prompted until
it does — a real trade, but far better than the observed spam (see README "Cooldown").

Every decision (block/allow, and which prompt variant) is also appended as one line to a
`firings.jsonl` log (see `_log_firing`) — the foundation for measuring, over time, whether
a firing led to real behavior change or was a rubber stamp; nothing here reads that log,
it only writes it. A `SELFCHECK_DISABLE=1` env var or a `DISABLED` sentinel file in
`MARKER_DIR` unconditionally allows the stop with no marker/log writes — a fast, no-code-
change kill switch if this hook is ever misbehaving in a live session.

Contract (agents-hooks/v1):
  stdin  : JSON event; a session/turn id in event.event_id (or args.session_id); an
           optional args.transcript_path (CC-forwarded) pointing at the turn's JSONL log
  stdout : protocol JSON only       exit 0 : allow   exit 10 : BLOCK   other : error

on_error is "open": a crash must never trap the agent unable to stop.

    Reads a BYTE-bounded window from the end of the file (seek + one bounded read), not

    every line of the file to fill the deque — only *retention* is bounded, not the I/O —
